# Prelude

Oliver Fletcher was a perfectly normal 12 year old boy. He had a little sister, Grace who was 9 and liked doing things that 9 year olds like doing, but 12 year olds do not like doing. Oliver and Grace lived with their mom Diane who worked doing something at a local insurance company. She'd described her job to Oliver before but it seemed very boring and Oliver didn't understand it<preview-break />.
They lived in a big boring Grey house, not an old house, but not a new house, just a normal house. It was on a quiet street where their neighbors were mostly older, boring and kept to themselves, as far as he knew Oliver and his sister were the only kids on the street.
Fairhaven, the town he lived in, was pretty non-descript. It was about an hour north of Clinton, a small city, and about an hour west of Neptune, a large beach town. In the summer months as the Neptune swelled with tourists Fairhaven town would get the spill over, people who were tired of putting their feet in the sand. A few of the local antique stores and art-galleries had made it onto lists of things to do when you need to get away from the beach. People would come and stroll about the picturesque mainstreet for a few hours, and then be back to wherever they really wanted to be in time for dinner.
School had ended for the summer a little more than a week before. As he bid farewell to 7th grade On the last day of school he'd wished his friends Steven and Kyle goodbye as they were all set to disperse for the summer. Steven's parent's owned one of the antique stores in town and he'd be working there most days now that school was done. The first week of the summer was always inventory week when Steven and his parents would get through the backlog of new acquisitions, and update the prices on all the existing items before the real summer rush started.
Kyle and Oliver usually attended daycamp together, but this year Kyle's parent's were taking the whole family on a _Grand Tour_. The trip was starting in England and then they were taking the train to France where they were going to rent a car and drive to Spain. Kyle had appologized since he was going to miss Olvier's birthday but Oliver had said that it was ok, just to bring him back something cool.
Oliver for his part was going to go to summer day camp but it didn't start for a few weeks so in the meantime his mother had decided that he was old enough to be home by himself.
So it was that with the daily monotony of school over Oliver found himself relegated to a new daily monotony. He'd wake up play video games, ride his bike around town a bit, and then return home to play more video games or watch some TV. One day he'd gotten bored and decided to go by Steven's families antique store. Last year Oliver, Kyle, and Steven had all helped out as Steven's parent's had gone through the new acquisitions, at the time he had wanted nothing more than to make an excuse to leave, but Steven alwasy said it was his favorite part of inventory week, and Oliver thought that maybe he could give it another try. When he got to the antique store he found Steven and his parents with packs of green stickers and pens and paper updating prices on items. They welcomed him in and Steven seemed excited to have a friend there so Oliver decided to stay. The work was tedious beyond compare, to make matters worse Steven decided that the best way to pass the time was to talk about all the cool new stuff they'd catalogued this summer. There were swords from Europe and Asia, Compasses from an old boat that was rumored to have been involved in piracy, and as always tons of maps and books. At the end of the day Steven's parent's had given Oliver and Steven enough money to go by some ice cream and pocket a few dollars. They ate their icecream quickly while Oliver dodged the question of what he'd been doing all summer and then going their seperate ways Oliver headed home to play some more video games before his Mom and Grace where home for dinner.

# Chapter 1. The Beach

On a particularly warm and sunny Wednesday Oliver woke up to his sister's excited yelling "We're going to the beach!" he rolled out of bed and still in his pjamas trudged down the stairs to the kitchen. There his mom had cooked some eggs and toast and poured some orange juice and sitting by their back door Oliver saw a large beach bag. "We're going to the beach?" he asked sleepily. "Yeah, I thought it would be good to escape the house for a bit" his mom answered, "WE'RE GOING TO THE BEACH!" Grace shouted nearly bouncing off the walls as she ran into the room excitedly. Oliver quickly ate some breakfast and went back to up his room to put on some beach clothes and then headed down just as his Mom was finishing packing the car with all the beach chairs, beach toys, a beach umbrella which looked like an orange slice, and various other beach things that you need to bring to the beach. With the car loaded they pulled out of the driveway and started down the 45 minute drive to the beach. In the front seat Oliver's mom slid a beach mix CD into the car's strero and the Beach boys started to play. His mom loved to make these mix CDs for car trips like this, and she was never shy about playing them loudly despite Oliver's occasional mortification.
When they arrived the beach was crowded. The tourists had started to arrive and early enough in the summer no-one had gotten bored with putting their feet in the sand just yet. On top of that it seemed like everyone from the city had decided to take advantage of the sunny day, skip work, and bring their friends and family to the beach with them. Oliver followed his mom and Grace, all three of them dragging various beach things alongh the sand, as they found the perfect spot. Just above the high-tide line but with a little space around them. With the umbrella up, the chairs set, and the toys unloaded Oliver's mom sat and grabbed her beach book, before she opened it she trained a stare on Oliver, "It's busy, stay with your sister. I don't want either of you getting lost!" "BUT –" Oliver started to protest but his mom narrowed her gaze in a way that said "don't you dare" without uttering a word, and Olvier decided it was best to accept her comand. Turning her gaze on Grace their Mom said "Remember Oliver is in-charge you need to listen to him ok?" "OK Mommy!" Grace said, her tone managed to be serious and still suck up to her mother for being so perfect. With that Diane opened her book while the two kids headed towards the water and the wetter sand to build a sand-castle. Oliver liked to start off with a large moat, piling the sand into the center, Grace had other ideas, she was busy trying to stack sand as high as possible to build a tower with a princess that needed to be rescued form it at the top. Forturnately after a few minutes of fighting over buckets Grace saw one of her friends from school, heading over to talk to her they both ran back to their mom's to see if they could hang out. With his sister now out of the picture Oliver could get to work on the sand castle. He started by knocking over Grace's tower, pricess and all, and then finished up the moat before starting in on the walls. Finally with the structure in place it was time to begin decorating. A piece of driftwood for a drawbridge, shells for windows, ane seaweed for flags. Pretty quickly Oliver had used up all the rocks and shells he'd found while building and taking an empty pail set off down the beach to find more interesting things. As he walked near the water Oliver watched as the waves washed over the beach and then receded. In the sand little shellfish bubbled as the water raced back to the ocean, around big rocks the water shaped the sand slowly exposing more of the ocean facing side. For finding shells though the best bet were the little shallow pools in the sand left by previous kids playing. In these the water and many times a shell or 2 would be deposited behind.
It was in one of these pools, one that was especially deep, as though some kids had been trying to dig their way through the entire beach, Oliver found a small round stone. At-first he thought nothing of it and grabbed it just in case, but then after a bit of cleaning he became fascinated by the rock. The rock itself was no more than 2 inches across, small enough to easily fit in Oliver's hand. It was the smoothest rock he had ever touched, worn by the ocean over many years it didn't have any chips or cracks. The color of itself initially seemed to Oliver to be a dark grey, but after washing any sand off he noticed the stone was a jet back, veined with these intricate white lines. Mostly oddly of all was just how round and flat the stone seemed to be. The edges were rounded slightly but seemed more like they had been finely polished then bumped around by the waves. The more he turned the stone over in his hands the more Oliver got an uneasy feeling that the stone wasn't just another beach rock but something else. In the end he decided his best bet was to put the stone in his pocket and show it to his Mom later. With the stone securly in a pocket Oliver looked around to get his bearnings. He had been so lost in a trance looking at the shell that he'd lost track of how far he'd walked. At first looking away from the water Oliver got worried when he didn't see his Mom with her telltale beach umbrella. Reaching into his pockets Oliver subconsciously started to hold the stone, turning it over and over. With the stone in his hand Oliver almost immediately spotted his Mom. She was much further down the beach then he remembered going, but her unmistakable umbrella and the sand-castle Oliver had built let him know it was cearly her. Heading back to his sandcastle Oliver found that the walls and some of the towers had been stepped on, judging from the size of the footprints he suspected that it was the older kids throwing a football nearby who where to blame. Moreover the rising tide had reached and started to fill his moat. Oliver knew a lost cause when we saw one and rather than try to repair the damage he decided to head back up the beach to their chairs leaving the castle to the fate of so many others, to turn into just another pool for kids like him to find shells in.
At the chairs Grace had returned, her friend was heading out for the day. Oliver's mom had opened their insulated bag and started to produce snacks and lunch, sandwiches. Oliver had hopped that they would go to the snack shack at the entrance and he could have a basket of french fries and chicken nuggets, but all the digging earlier had left him pretty hungry so he sat and quickly ate the sandwich. After they'd all finished eating his mom turned to Oliver with a serious look on her face. Oliver got nervous thinking he'd done something wrong till she asked, "Do you want to go get icecream?" as she spoke she pulled a few folded bills from her pocket and offered them to Oliver. "THANKYOU" Oliver said quickly taking the bills and getting ready to sprint off. "Take Grace with you!" his mom called after him. Oliver gave an inaudible huff as he slowed down and waited for his sister to catch up with him while she hummed "I scream, you scream, we all scream for icecram" softly. In the excitement with the food and icecream Oliver had completely forgotten to show his mom the rock. Shoving the bills into his pocked Oliver touched the stone, he thought about stopping and turning back to his Mom for a moment. "Come on!" Grace was dragging on his other hand and Oliver quickly let thoughts of the stone go, took his hand out of his pocket, and headed off to get icecream.
The rest of the day seemed to go back at high speed. They'd gotten icecream, returned to the chairs, eatten, then Oliver had swam in the ocean a bit. Finally as the rising ocean threatend to set a new high tide record they'd hurridly packed up their stuff and loaded the car. With the last of the shovels and the buckets loaded Oliver and Grace climbed into the back seats and buckled up for the ride home. Almost immediately as their call pulled out of the beach parking lot and joined the flow of traffic Oliver felt himself nodding off to sleep.

# Chapter 2. The Tower

Oliver awoke groggy and disoriented in a small grey stone room. The room was poorly furnished with a simple table and chair in one corner, and the small lumby bed that he was currently sitting on in the other corner. Light shone into the room from a dusty window with thick wavy glass, opposite the window a door made of rough planks with a large iron handle stood. Oliver got up and approached the window finding a handle to pull it open so he could see properly. With the window opened he realized he was rather far off the ground, Oliver liked to think he wasn't afraid of heights but the sudden realization of just how high up he was turned his stomache slightly. Timidly looking down he saw a green coutyard surrounded on all sides by large stone walls. Beyond the walls he could see a large bay in front of him, small ships with 1 or 2 sails seemed to float lazily in the distance. To his left the ground seemed to slope down from the walls and he could see the low stone buildings of a town spread out. He could see one wall of the city that ran along the water line, fruther down a large inlet was full of what seemed like small boats and even from this distance Oliver could tell it was a busy port. Beyond the port lay what seemed to be an increasingly chaotic series of low brown buildings.
Glancing around the room once again Oliver noted things he'd seen from illustrations of medival life, a ceramic wash basin for his hands laid out on the table, empty of water. Underneath the bed a chamber pot for going to the bathroom, thankfully empty of eveything. Remembering some of the adventure games he played at home on the computer Oliver pulled the sheets off the bed to make sure there was nothing of any value hidden there. With the bed clearly empty Oliver crossed to the door, pulled on the large iron ring, and the door swung open. Outside was a small landing that connected to a spiraling staircase that wound clockwise up to his left, and counterclockwise down to his right. The landing had no windows and was illuminated by a faint yellow light coming from a sconce on the wall. Looking at it Oliver could see that the sconce was made from a glass jar with some sort of liquid inside. The yellow glow of the light seemed to be coming from the liquid itself as there didn't seem to be any lightbulbs or flames that he'd seen in old lamps.
Turning from the curious sconce Oliver considered the stairs ahead of him. Having no desire to go any further up this tower Oliver opted to make his way down. The stairs were narrow and wound tightly so that on every full turn Oliver came to another landing like the one he had left. On each landing a sconce and a simple wooden door with large iron ring handles that stood closed. Oliver counted 1, 2, 3, 4 of these landings before the pattern was broken. This time a half turn of the stairs brought him to a larger landing. Here in place of a single sconce two stood flanking a large door with detailed iron fittings and bracing. There was no handle on this door, giving Oliver the sense that this was not a door to be opened. A final half turn of the stairs took Oliver to the ground floor. Here the grey stones of the building were laid out as smooth pavers. A single wide archway opened up along one side of the tower and bright sunlight streamed in. Oliver stepped outside and took a moment to adjust his eyes to the brightness. The courtyard seemed sleeply, it's green grass was crossed with worn paths where many men and animals had likely walked before. Turning to his right Oliver saw the cliffs of a large mountain raising up into the clouds. The courtyard seemed pressed up against these mountains the walls joining them and almost melting into them. Stepping further into the courtyard and turning around to see the way he had come Oliver saw an intricuitly carved stone castle, and next to it the tall tower he had been in, raising high up above the wall. Like the walls and the tower the castle facade was carved from grey stone, however the castle itself seemed to reach it's way back into the side of the mountain. The only activity in the courtyard was a team of people constructing what looked like a wooden stage in front of the castle.
Oliver went to leave the courtyard making a B-line for a gate he'd seen that seemed to lead to the town below. However much to his dissapointment he found the gate from the countyard closed blocking his path. As he turned to find another way out he heard a man call out. "Hey you there!" emerging from a alcove that Oliver hadn't noticed a large man wearing a metal helmet, a bright red tunic, and carrying a small sword appeared. The shock of seeing this man left Oliver speechless. "You!" The man said again, almost shouting, "What are you doing here?". "I just woke up in that tower." Oliver answered honestly "I'm not sure how I got here". "Just woke up? It's practically mid-day, the coronation is going to be in just a few hours." The man was clearly displeased with Oliver's answer, then as though he needed a minute to consider exactly what Oliver was saying the man suddenly drew his sword and stepped forward towards Oliver. "What do you mean you don't know how you got here?! Who are you anyway?". "Oliver" was the only thing that Oliver could think to respond, he'd never been questioned with a sword pointed at him before. "Are you a spy for Orless? What are you doing here?" Oliver wasn't sure who or what Orless was but he knew he wasn't a spy so he thought sticking to 1 word answers was the best option "No." With that the man lunged forward. Oliver closed his eyes expecting the man was going to stab him with the sword, but instead a gloved hand grabbed his arm tightly. Opening his eyes Oliver heard the man say "I'm taking you in". Oliver was happy just not to be stabbed and hoped that at least where ever "in" was it might answer some of the questions that he had about this place. The man lead Oliver back to the alcove that he'd emerged from, Oliver noticed a narrow wooden door at the back. Sheathing his sword the man knocked 3 times on the door, it opened and another large man dressed in the same manner stood beyond. These must be the castle guards, Oliver thought. The guard who was holding him shoved him roughly towards this new guard. "Found this one wandering the courtyard, he won't tell me how he got here, he may be an Orless spy". With that Oliver was taken up by the new gurad and pulled rather roughly into the narrow passage. With the door closed behind them the passage was dark. Light shone in from a series of openings along the ceiling but it took a minute for Oliver to get his bearings and see the way they were headed. After a series of twists, turns, and intersections they eventually decended a set of stairs and then the passage opened up into a large open room lit by more of the dim yellow lamps. In the center of the room a table stood with more uniformed guards sitting around it, some were drinking and eating, others just talking quitely. Oliver was lead across the room to a door that had a large wooden brace holding it shut. Some of the guards moved the brace, opened the door, and Oliver was pushed in, the door slammed behind him.
Sitting in the dark room Oliver tried to get his bearings and clear his head. As he did he began to realize how much trouble he was in. Clearly he was in a prison cell, and clearly they suspected him of being a spy. He knew he wasn't a spy but he also knew that without knowing how he came to be in that tower there's no way he could convice anyone that he wasn't a spy. In the darkness Oliver groped around trying to make out the features of the room, hoping there was something, anything he could use to break out. The door was in front of him heavy and solid, then a wall, corner, wall, corner, wall, corner, wall, corner, wall, and back to the door. He had gone all the way around the room. It was about 5 feet to either side. Closing his eyes Oliver hoped that maybe this was all a dream and he would wake up. Opening his eyes slowly he saw the darkness broken by a ray of light then all at-once the door to the cell was opened and two guards entered with small lanterns that they placed in holders on the walls. With the room lit now Oliver could see that it was made from the same grey stones that he'd seen throughout the castle. The two guards left and another man this one not wearing a helmet or sword entered. He was tall with a hard face that wore a scowl. His dark hair was cut short and was receeding a bit in the front, making him seem older than the other guards Oliver had seen. He carried a wooden chair that he set down near the center of the room then he gestured behind him and the door was closed. Sitting in the chair the man looked over Oliver, "I'm Sir Eren of the Andmore Royal Guard, and I'm told you're a spy for Orless." Hopeing to avoid the sort of medeval death that were often described sparingly in the same books on medeval life that he'd read Oliver gave the only response he could, "I'm not a spy, and I don't even know what Orless is, or how I got here, or where I even am." Smiling Sir Eren answered back, "Why don't you tell me what you do know". Oliver launched into a rambling account of his day. What he'd had for breakfast, his trip to the beach, getting back into the car, then waking up in the tower. As he talked Sir Eren nodded along showing no hint if he believed Oliver or not. Just as Oliver was getting to the point where he'd left the tower and entered the courtyard there was a knock at the door. "Sir you're needed for the coronation!" came the voice from outside. Sir Eren stood, picked up the chair said one word to Oliver "Wait" with that he kocked 3 times on the door to the cell, it was opened and he left with the door closing and loudly latching behind him. Oliver could hear some muffled conversations beyond the door but couldn't make out what anyone was saying. He slumped back on the floor of the cell, thankful that at-least the lanterns left behind meant that the room wasn't pitch black.
With the darkness gone Oliver set about planning After what seemed like an hour, but may have only been a few minute there was more commotion from outside the cell. Oliver rushed to the door and pressed his ear against the door to see if he could hear. Rather than voices he heard the scraping sound of the wooden brace being lifted off of the door, Oliver quickly stepped back, just in time as the door swung open nearly knocking him off his feet. The short man that entered was old and wore a long flowing red robe. He was mostly bald but the grey hair at the back of his head was long and tied in a pony tail that ran nearly all the way down his back. A longgrey beard that fell well below his neck matched this. His skin was a dark olive tone with deep wrinkles that seemed to suggest a lifetime of hard won knowledge. As he entered the room his beard was brushed aside for a moment and Oliver saw hanging from around his neck a gold chain with a perfectly round jet black stone that had the same white veining on it as the stone he'd found at the beach. "That stone!" Oliver cried realizing now that it must somehow be involved in whatever it was that was happening to him. The old man was startled but then moved his beard aside so Oliver could see the stone better. "You've seen a stone like this before?" "Yes I found one on the beach" Oliver answered. "Come with me!" the old man turned suddenly and left the room. Oliver not wanting to let this chance to escape his cell go followed as quickly as he could. Thankfully the guards in the room beyond didn't seem to question the old man as he stormed throught the room, out another door and into another narrow hallway. Oliver followed as closely as he could and they started to wind their way through a series of increasingly maze like hallways. Oliver was happy to be free from the prison but now nervous, the old man was moving faster than Oliver thought possible for someone of his age and if he got even a few steps behind he would be lost in this labrynth of passages forever. After going through a few doorways the old man started to speak, "This is no mear stone, it's a Merstone. The Merfolk of the southern sea make them, and their artificers enchant them with great power. Sir Eren when he was called away from your interrogation told me of your strange story hoping that I could see if you had gone mad. That you have seen a Merstone I think can only mean one thing. Tell me did you touch the stone?" The old man paused and Oliver realized that the qustion was directed to him. "Yes" was the only response he could get off while trying to keep up. "Indeed, well..." trailing off the old man became silent for a bit, he opened a door ahead of them and much to Oliver's surprise the emerged through the large door in the Tower that Oliver had woken up in. From there the man lead the way back upstairs. Oliver at first thought they were returning to the room he'd originally worken up in, but as he counted the floors they passed the door, still open to the room. 2 more circles of the staircase and it finally ended with a door in the ceiling. The old man pushed this open and they exited the stairs into a large round room with windows on all sides and tables covered in paper and glass vials throughout.
Looking about the room Oliver finally caught his breath enought to ask, "Who are you?" "I'm Lucas, the offical socerer and magical advisor to the King of Andmore." "Andmore? That's where we are right?" Oliver asked his head spinning from what little information he'd been given so far. "Ah yes, pardon me, you may say that we don't often get travelers here." Lucas said with a chuckle as though it was funny. "You are in Castle Andmore. here..." Lucas moved to a large table and shifting many papers aside produced a large map. The map showed a crecent shape coming almost to a complete circle. In the middle was what appeared from the illustrations to be water, at the top of the map were drawings that showed trees and animals. bits of the map to the top where clearly incomplete as though the map maker had forgotten to draw them. "Here!" Lucas pointed to a point along the water near the widest part of the crecent. "This is Andmore, and..." moving his fingers to the left "This is Orless. The two cities have long been rivals, although our rivaly rarely turns to war, we share the Bay of Midwater and trade goods back and forth. The Merfolk, the people who made these stones", Lucas tapped the stone around his neck, "Their kingdom lays underthe southern sea, here." Lucas' hand now pointed to part where the two arms of the crescent nearly met, "They control the narrows and keep us from exploring further ashore." "What about up here?" Oliver asked pointing at the unfinished portion of the map. "That..." Lucas paused, "That is the shadow lands. Where the land boarders on the bay here it is safe for us. We have built our cities and farms, we fish and hunt, but beyond the mountain's ridge" Lucas used two hands to trace an arc that cut the land in half, "beyond that, there are horrors that no human should have to face." With that Lucas seemed solom, Oliver wasn't sure but he thought he noticed a tear forming in Lucas' eye, before it was blinked away. "But enough of where you are let's get you back to where you belong" Lucas reached over and without warning plucked a hair from Oliver's head "Ow!" Oliver yelped but before the shock of having a hair plucked could even register Lucas was off again. He swirled about the room with a manic energy, collecting various glass vials, mixing, and then seemingly from out of nowhere lighting a small fire in a pot on one of the tables. Within minutes a light blue liquid had filled a small vial which was suspended over the little fire. Lucas dropped the hair into the liquid and then offered a pleased "ha!" as the liquid turned a dark red. Turning to Oliver Lucas smiled and said, "I'm needed at the coronation now, you may watch the ceremony from the window there" he gestured to one of the windows "when the liquid in this vial turns clear drink it and you will return home." With that Lucas strode towards the open trapdoor not waiting for Oliver to respond. "Thankyou!" Oliver said quickly not wanting to seem ungrateful. "One more thing" Lucas offered turning as he reached the first stair. "This room is full of potions that will kill you quickly, and knowledge that will kill you slowly, best you don't touch any of it." With that Lucas spun his robe billowing behind him and decended the stairs.
With Lucas gone Oliver looked at the vial, it was still a dark red but had started to lighten a little. He moved over the window Lucas had gestured to and opened it. The view was much like the one Oliver had seen from the bedroom below, however the window was oriented a bit more towards the castle. Looking down Oliver could see the finished stage. As he watched Lucas appeared from the base of the tower and ascended steps that were located along the back of the stage. Almost as if on cue the sounds of horns filled the air. From the city gate a procession moved into the courtyard, filled with men dressed in blue. A guard at the gate shouted out the annoucment. "THE DELEGATION FROM THE REPUBLIC OF ORLESS". The group moved towards the stage and people took up seats that were offered to them. With the delegation in place more horns followed and then from inside the castle came another group, this time wearing the red uniforms that Oliver had come to know where from Andmore. From his high perch Oliver couldn't be certain but the man leading the procession seemed to be Sir Eren, the guard who had interrogated him earlier. Behind the guards were 2 people, the King and Queen Oliver assumed based on their ornate dress. They climbed the stage, took their seats and a hush fell over the courtyard. Lucas stood and began addressing the crowd that had gathered. From the tall tower Oliver had a hard time hearing but it seemed to be a fairly dry geneology of the King and Queen, giving credence to their coronation. Turning to look at the vial Oliver saw that it had turned perfectly clear, there was no trace of red, or the hair that had been placed in it. Below the vial the small fire had turned to embers and was about to burn out. Taking the vial in one hand Oliver drank it quickly. The liquid inside was ice cold and caused a shiver to run up his body, the taste was bitter and nutty, almost instantly Oliver's stomache seemed to twist. Oliver remembered Lucas' warnings about the potions and suddenly wondered if he'd just drunk poision but before he could spit the liquid out he felt his legs go numb and he collapsed on the floor losing conciousness.
Oliver awoke in the backseat of his car just as they were slowing down to turn into the driveway. He felt like he was in a stupor but quickly his big grey house and his little sister and his mom came into sharper relief. As they did the memories of Andmore quickly left his mind as nothing more than dreams.

#Chapter 3. Night
After dinner, and more ice cream, and a movie, it was well past the time for Oliver and Grace to go to bed. Heading upstairs and changing into his pjamas Oliver noticed that the rock he had found at the beach was still in his pocket. He took it out and placed it on the bookshelf in his room, next to the small pewter statue of a knight that he'd gotten when he was 4 on a family trip to the nearby castle. Oliver brushed his teeth, climbed into bed and picked up the book he was reading about alien invaders. He lay down and started to read but only made it about 2 pages before he found himself too sleepy to keep going. He closed the book, turned off his reading light, closed his eyes, and.
Oliver awoke on the cold stone floor. He looked about the room. It was exactly as it had been when he'd taken the potion. The trapdoor was still open to the stairs below, the window was still open into the courtyard outside. From the open window Oliver could hear voices yelliing although he couldn't tell what they were yelling about, and he could smell smoke. He assumed that a party was happening outside, what were the celebrating again? That's right the coronation. Standing up Oliver made his way to the open window. The sky was dark and he could see stars in the distance so night had clearly come. Looking outside Oliver couldn't beleive what he saw, where he expected there to be a party there was instead chaos. The stage and seating had been smashed and it looked like it had been burnt. Across from the castle the wall that boarded the sea also looked like it had been smashed open and a fire raged around it. All around the courtyard people were screaming and running around with buckets trying to put out fires. Oliver turned and headed for the stiars, taking them 2 at a time so he could get to the bottom faster. Whatever was going on he needed to find Lucas and get back home again.
Nearing the bottom of the stairs Oliver noticed that again the large door that he and Lucas had come through was closed. Out into the courtyard Oliver shouted to one of the people trying to put out fires with buckets of water. "What happened?!" "We're under attack!" was the cry back as the person ran off for more water. Attack, Lucas had explained an animosity between Orless and Andmore but he said it rarely became violent. Was the attack from Orless, or maybe the shadow lands that Lucas seemed to not want to discuss. Oliver suspected Lucas could explain all of this just before sending him home, if only he could find him. "Where is Lucas?" Oliver asked another person who had appeared with a new bucket of water. "Lucas?" the man didn't seem to know who Oliver was talking about. "Old man, sorcerer to the King or something." Oliver added trying desperately to remember Lucas' title. "If he's with the king's guard then they've gone down into the city to defend the port." The man yelled back before throwing water on a fire and running off to fetch more. Oliver turned to the gate to the city and found it open still. He made his way to the gate, avoiding any of the small fires that lingered from what was previously the stage.
The path from the Gate into the city was a wide road that criss crossed down a small hill before becoming an even wider throughfare that lead to the port. The road was empty of carts or people and Oliver was able to quickly get down to the city level. Once there he found more chaos. The main road was interested by many smaller streets where houses and shops seemd to press into one another. Much like the castle much of the city that he could see here was built from grey stones. The roofs were wooden or thatched with some kind of straw. To Oliver's horror he noticed that quite a few of the houses around town where on fire. Much of the screaming and runshing about were people trying to get possessions out of houses that were burning, or next to ones that were already on fire. Meanwhile other people were bringing buckets of water and trying the seemlessly hopeless task of putting out the fires. Trying to avoid the chaos Oliver stayed on the main street and quickly made his way down to the port. As he neared the port the chaos started to die down, but he could hear shouting that sounded less like terror and more like someone giving orders.
The port of Andmore ran along a long inlet. It provided plenty of space for boats to dock and a good defensive position if ever someone tried to attack by sea. Across the water Oliver now got his first real look across the inlet to the village on the other side. The crossing was made with a series of floating and somewhat makeshift bridges where the boats were docked and a large stone bridge where the inlet narrowed fruther down. The houses on the other side where largly wood, small, and very much on fire. The people that he could see from where he was standing seemed to have largely resigned their houses to burn and were gathering possessions and making their way to boats that were tied up along the inlet. The clothes these people wore gave away the fact that they were very poor, they were far worst dressed than even the servents who were helping put out fires at the castle. Oliver guessed that these were probably fisherman and dock workers and their families. Unable to afford living in the city on this side of the inlet they'd decided to build their own close to the boats.
Oliver heard again the shouting as if someone was giving orders, looking around he saw a man he recoginzed, Sir Eren, standing along the top of the city's seaside wall, around him were men dressed in the guard uniform he had seen before. Oliver knew that if anyone here could help him find Lucas it would be Sir Eren so he turned and made his way to the city wall. The walls for the city were quite large up-close. Here at the base nearest the inlet a large stone building extended from the wall itself. Oliver stepped inside and found himself in a lavish recieving room. The room felt familiar and he made his way as if by memory to the back of the room, around a small courtyard and then into a staircase. The stairs took him up and before long he found himself emerging along a battlement at the top of the city wall. Here the space at the top of the wall was at it's widest, clearly made for guards to be stationed and conduct their duties defending the port beyond. It was here that Sir Eren was standing sending men off along the battlement to deal with the attack that was coming from the bay below. Looking over the bay the darkness made it hard to see much, but Oliver could make out the dark shapes of boats, some coming closer to the city and others keeping their distance. Suddenly from out of nowhere a large ball of fire lit up the night and came flying through the air. It arced down and landed in the water short of the wall but close. "They're getting closer!" yelled one of the guards. "Hold the line" was Sir Eren's response back. Oliver approached Sir Eren carefully not wanting to startle him when he was so clearly on edge. Oliver was right to to worry as he took barely a step forward and Sir Eren spun and drew his sword so fast that he seemed a blur. For a second Oliver thought he would die but Sir Eren just stared at him for a moment then said, "You, I thought Lucas dealt with you?" Rather than trying to explain everything Oliver just opted to ask the question he was here for in the first place, "I'm looking for Lucas, do you know where he is?" "Back at the Castle with King Adem" responded Sir Eren. "Here", he pointed at the narrow battlement that ran along the top of the city wall. "Follow this and you'll find stairs that will take you up to the castle. When you find Lucas, tell him we need a bit of his help down here, we're fighting blind, we can't even see who's attacking us." With that Sir Eren turned his attention back to the water and sheathed his sword. Oliver looked down the long narrow battlement nervously, he imagined waht would happened if one of those fireballs crashed into the wall while he was walking. Swallowing the knot in his throat he started to make his way back towards the castle.
Although he passed plenty of soldiers shouting and trying to find good positions to hold the wall the walk back to the castle went smoothly. Fortunately no more fireballs were flung at the city. When Oliver reached the end of the city wall he found the stairs Sir Eren had mentioned where the castle wall started and began to climb. At the end of the stairs was a narrow wooden door that exited into an alcove to the courtyard. Here the commotion had largely died down. The fires where the stage had been were largely put out, and rather than running back and forth the servents had formed a bucket bridage and were passing buckets of water from inside the castle to where a small fire still burned at the walls. Oliver ran to the main doors of the castle and wasn't surprised to find them securely locked. The bucket bridage were using a side entrance that Oliver assumed led to the kitchen based on the way many of the servents were dressed. He pushed past some of the people and made his way into the caste. Just inside the doors a staircase stood, the servents were passing buckets from downstairs, so Oliver went up. The stairs were short and ended with a door that opened into a small hallway that lead to a large banquet hall. From here Oliver was able to make his was into the main foyer of the castle. He passed coats of arms, various statues and trophies and then going through an open doorway entered what was clearly the throne room.
The throne room was a smaller room than Oliver would have expected. Unlike the grey stone that was so prominate througout the city and castle this room seemed to be carved from the almost black stone of the mountain itself, although the walls were decorated with wood and fabrics covering most of this. King Adem sat on his throne, the smaller throne beside it lay vacant, standing in front of the King with his back turned to the door was the unmistakable form of Lucas. Oliver approached the pair and the King stopped talking and looked up at him. "Who are you?" the king asked. Lucas turned and upon seeing Oliver had a look of dismay on his face. Before Oliver could speak however Lucas cut in. "This is Oliver your highness, he is a traveler from a distant land who has returned here at a most unforturnate time." Not sure what to do Oliver bowed slightly and muttered "At your service", he wasn't really sure why he said this but it felt like the sort of thing you say to a King. "What was that?" The king demanded. Summoning up his courage this time Oliver answered a bit louder. "At your service, your highness." then he quickly added "Also Sir Eren requests the aid of Lucas as they cannot see the foes attacking the city." With that Oliver looked up to see Lucas' face twist from sadness to a smile. "Master Oliver and I beg your leave your highness we are needed elsewhere in defense of our city!" The King nodded to Oliver and whispered something to Lucas, Lucas whispered back and Oliver had the sinking feeling they were discussing him. Suddenly King Adem stood and said "Master Oliver I accept your service in this time of our need." With that the king turned and exited the throne room from a door concealed in a side wall. Stepping down off the dias Lucas grabbed Oliver by the arm squeezing a little to hard as if to ensure that he was real then lead him out of the room.
Oliver got a distinct feeling of DeJaVu as he followed behind Lucas through the twisting halls in the castle. As they walked Lucas began again to offer an unhelpful explaination of the situation. "It's worse than I feared I'm sorry to say. These Merstones, they're tricky, enchanted in ways that are often beyond our understanding... but no-matter where there's a will as they say. Still it's not without hope and perhaps we can kill 2 birds with one stone." With that Lucas let out a little chuckle. They turned the corner opened a door and again found themselves back in the tower. Oliver followed Lucas to the top and watched impressed again as he first clossed the window and then set about mixing various vials and setting various small fires in little braziers. Finally Lucas turned to Oliver, behind him 3 vials of a light blue liquid that Oliver recognized as the potion that sent back home were prepared. Next to them a large flask of a bright yellow liquid that like the lanterns gave a faint yellow glow, and another smaller flask of something that looked black but with a red shimmer as it bubbled over a small fire. "Now" Lucas said, "you know the drill. I need 3 strands of your hair and it's best if I do it." Oliver gritted his teeth as Lucas plucked 3 hairs one at a time from his head and dropped them in the vials. They instantly turned red and then quickly started to lighten. With that Lucas went to a closet that was pushed up against a wall of the room and returned with something that looked like a cross bow. Grabbed the yellow and black flasks he started to head for the stairs. "Best if you stay with me I think, we'll come back for those" Lucas said gesturing to the vials that now were a faint pink. With that Lucas lead Oliver down the stairs and out of the tower. Lucas lead the way across the courtyard to where the bucket brigade seemed to have just finished with the fire. He winched the crossbow into place, loaded the yellow flask into a pouch on the bow and then quickly poured the black flask into the yellow one. The two liquids seemed to swirl together as-if fighting yeach other. Raising the crossbow to his shoulder and aiming it high into the air Lucas quickly fired it off through the large gap where the wall had been destroyed. The yellow flask nearly dissapeared into the night sky except for the faint glow it left behind. After a second it exploded lighting up the night sky like a firework, but unlike a firework the light hung there leaving an impression of twighlight. With this light cast over the bay Oliver could see the boats he'd seen before more clearly now, they didn't seem like warships but rather just regular old boats. Just then as if in answer to the light a huge ball of fire appeared from under the water and launched itself through the sky towards the city. It cleared the walls and crashed into the buildings, starting a new round of fires. "Like I said" was all Lucas could respond and then he turned and headed back to the tower, gestruing with Oliver to keep up.
Back at the top of the Tower Lucas again set about his manic work. He put cork stoppers in the 3 vials that he'd mixed earlier which now had turned clear. He prepared a seies of more potions and placed them in stoppered vials, he rummaged through books until he found a small leatherbound one, then flipped through scattered papers placing a few neatly folded between the pages of the book, finally he went to the closet where he had gotten the crossbow and found a large knarled stick and worn out bag. Turning to Oliver Lucas finally seemed to take a breath and let his stern face drop. "I imagine you are confused by all of this?" Lucas asked, not waiting for a response "For as long as we can remember Orless and Andmore have been rivals but our true enemies are not each other but the Merfolk whose control of the narrows keeps both our cities from growing beyond the confines of the bay. The Merfolk have always contented themselves to keep the status quo but today that was suddenly thrown into disarray. These attacks are from the Merfolk, why they are attacking and what they hope to gain I do not know. However I believe it's your presence in our city that has brought them here. You see I told you before that you were a traveler, this world is not your world Oliver. It is beyond any human skill to move between worlds freely but the Merfolk are far more skilled at magic than any human. The potion I gave you before, I was hopeful it would return you to your world for good, but alas it seems the enchantment that Merstone was imbued with it is beyond my skill. In order to stop this attack the enchantment must be broken. Now sadly we must go out seperate ways. These three potions I've mixed will return you to your world but leave your memory intact. This book is my diary from the year that I spent in the shadow lands I've also given you maps of the island that should help you in your quest. Finally this staff is fashioned from a tree deep in the shadow lands it should offer you some protection on your jorney." Oliver looked at Lucas in disbelief and confusion Lucas placed the book and vials into the bag. Handing the bag and staff to Oliver, Lucas lead them out of the tower one last time. This time they stopped on the landing before the large door. Lucas pushed gently and the door opened as if by magic. "Go to the end of this hall, take a left then your first right and you'll be back to the throne room. From there you'll find a secret door behind a tapsetry with birds on it, that leads to a passage deep into the mountain and stairs that will take you out to the shadow lands. There is a rarely used path that will bring you to Orless, it's not without danger but it's certainly safer than taking a boat if the Merfolk are after you." With that Lucas turned to go, "Wait!" Oliver cried "How am I supposed to break the enchantment?" Smiling Lucas turned back "I don't know. Get to Orless and find the sorcerers guild there, they may have the skill to reverse the enchantment. It may be that you need to travel to the Mer Kingdom itself or find a way to break the enchantment in your own world, but I can only start you on this path you must find your own way" "And if I can't?" Oliver asked. Lucas gave a laugh "You offered the King of Andmore your aid, if you can't break the enchantment and keep the Merfolk from attacking our city then you'll have broken your oath and..." Lucas trailed off but Oliver had a sense for what the punishment for breaking an oath to the King was. With that Lucas departed heading out into the castle courtyard with one last call of "Good Luck!"

#Chapter 4. The Shadow Lands
Oliver followed Lucas' instructions and found the hidden stairs. The tunnel they were in was dark but fortuneatly a lantern glowed near the bottom. Oliver grabbed it and taking it with him started up the widing stairs. The stairs seemed to go on forever but eventually they gave way to flat narrow tunnel the curved and then opened up to reveal the night's sky. The path that Lucas had described lead along a ridge about halfway up the mountain. makeing it's way away from the bay. Holding the lantern high Oliver found that he had no problem seeing the path a head of him and started to walk. As he walked he tried to get his bearings. The path was winding it's way along the side of the mountain, to his left the mountain rose up and out of sight, to his right lay a dense forest as far as he could see. After walking for a few minutes along the edge between mountain and forest Oliver started to notice the forest almost rising up to meet him, a few more minutes and small trees started to enclose the path and then he was in the forest. Looking ahead the trees swallowed the light from the lantern and the path seemed to dissapear. Not wanting to go any further Oliver back tracked to where the trees first started. He was tired but worried about sleeping in such a precarious spot. However he found a few small trees that seemed strudy and using the staff Lucas had given him fashioned a sort of seat that he wouldn't fall out of. With that he closed his eyes and went to sleep.
Oliver awoke, sore, thirsty, and hungry. He tried to remember the last time he ate or drank anything - dinner but that was in his world, did that count? The lantern he had taken from the passage had stopped glowing and the liquid inside was now a dim yellow but almost clear. Fortunately the sun had started to rise, although the mountain left him largely shaded from it's light. Leaving the lantern behind and getting up Oliver stretched and began following the trail again, into the forest. With the sun filtering through the trees Oliver understood immediately why this place was called the Shadow Lands. Within a few feet of entering the forest Oliver had to stop and let his eyes adjust to the darkness, even then it was almost as dark as it had been the night before. Still he was able to pick out the trail and move forward. The drawings on the map he had seen in Lucas' tower seemed to suggest the shadow lands would be full of monsters but as he walked Oliver didn't see anything particularly monsterous. He wondered if he should stop to consult Lucas' journal or the maps he'd been given, but the trail seemed straight forward and fairly level so he felt confident following it.
After walking for a few hours Oliver came to a stream that cut across the path, here the ridge line had widened more and just off the trail he could hear the bubbling of the stream as it reached a pool. Thinking that he could get a drink Oliver stepped off the trail and followed the stream through the dense forest until the trees gave way and a small clearing opened up with a pool at it's center. Sitting on moss covered rock near the pool and scooping some water to his mouth Oliver almost immediately began to feel better. Sitting and letting his sore legs and feet rest Oliver pulled Lucas' journal from his bag and started reading.

```
The Journal of Lucas Álvarez's journey through the Shadow Lands.
I'm writing this journal in the unlikely chance that I succeed on this journey. I know my training at the sorcerers guild has given me some of the skill I need but I also realize that no other member of my guild has managed to return from a mission to these lands. Alas I don't come here of my own accord. My plan to travel on an emissary trip to Andmore with my dearest Valeria has been ruined. I know now that although we thought ourselves careful, suspicions of our illicit relationship were gossiped throughout the guild hall. My superiors decision to replace me on the trip at the last minute has left us little other choice. Valeria will travel to Andmore and defect as we had both planned. I am setting out tonight to journey through the shadow lands and find a land route into Andmore.

I've walked for what has felt like days, but I fear is only hours. Slipping from Orless was rather easy, guild business would regularly take me to the farms on the northern slope. However actually entering the shadow lands was another matter. I had done what research I could at the guild hall before departing. It is said that the shadow lands are like a predator laying in wait for it's prey to enter. However from my experience it's a picky predator, upon first entereing the forest I found myself so turned around in the dark that I quickly came back out where I had started. I'm not ashamed to say I did this 3 times before I finally managed to get far enough into the forest to move forward. Once in the forest it's so dark and so thick that all sense of direction is lost. The one thing I know is that I should be headed towards the top of the mountain so I tried to find a path that leads roughly up-hill. I'm sure my path is winding and indirect but I feel exhillerated to be on the path at-all.

I've found a stream! The source must be the same as the waterfalls we see cascading down from the mountain, by following the stream back to it's source I'll have a much straighter path to the mountain. I know the forest breaks as it reaches the steepest parts of that mountain so with some luck I should be able to get out of the forest and above the tree line. For now the stream has lead me to a small pool where I've stopped for a drink. I hadn't realized just how tierd, thirsty, and sore...
```

Oliver awoke, Lucas' journal lay open on his chest where it had fallen as he dozed off. The pool seemed peaceful but thinking back to the warnings he'd been given of the shadow lands he quickly picked up the book and closed it. As he was shutting it he noticed a frantic scribling at the bottom of the page. "...disenchantment revealed the correct path...". Thinking nothing of this he tucked the journal in his backpack, stood up, grabbed the wooden staff and followed the stream back the way he'd come. As he reached the woods he noticed the staff was no longer in his hand, looking back it was sitting where he'd put it down before beside the pool. That was odd as he was sure he had picked it up. Still he turned back grabbed the staff and headed out. Again as he reached the trees he found the staff missing and saw it laying by the pool. Lucas had told him the staff would protect him, but it seemed now to be trying to keep him at this pool forever. "Stupid stick" Oliver muttered under his breath and pushed through the forest without it. After following the stream for a few feet the woods opened up and Oliver found himself staring at the same pool he had been at before the staff was even resting right where he'd left it.
Panicked Oliver grabbed the staff and tried to back-track the way he'd come, again the staff seemed to dissapear from his hands when he wasn't watching it and return to it's resting spot beside the pool. Desperately Oliver tried to stare at the staff as he carried it into the forest but with his attention focused on the staff he found no mater which direction he walked he seemed to stay beside the pool. Utterly confused and fearing he would die at this pool Oliver slumped back on the moss covered rock he had sat on before. Opening the backpack he drew out one of the clear vials that Lucas had given him. Lucas had said that he may need to return to his world to rid himself of this enchantment. Oliver was about to unstopper the vial when he thought better of this idea. He only had 3 of these and he was unsure when he could get more. Knowing that when he was back in his world he may only have till he fell asleep before returning he realized that he needed to get himself out of this bind. As he put the vials back into the bag he saw Lucas' journal and on a hunch drew it out and turned to the page he had been reading. At the bottom a hastily scrawled note read "This pool is covered by an enchantment that prevents me from leaving. A hasty disenchantment revealed the correct path which I'll now follow. I must remember to be more careful here."
Oliver didn't know how disenchant something, hasilty or otherwise. Thinking that maybe the answer lay elsewhere in the book he rifled through it. The first half of the book was page upon page of Lucass handwriting, as it went it grew increasingly chaotic and scribbled. Lucas had told Oliver that he'd spent a year in the Shadow Lands but from the begining of this diary it seemed his plan was just to walk between Orless and Andmore, what had happened that it had taken a whole year, and more importantly would it take Oliver that long to reach Orless? The second half of the diary almost seemed to have been written by another person alltogether, the structure of the writing was neat and looked almost analytical, interspersed throughout the text were diagrams and drawings. Some of monsters with labels, others of plants and fruits. Oliver folded the corner of the page where this section started, if he was destined to spend a year in the Shadow Lands he wanted to read this part of the diary and learn all that he could. Then about three quarters of the way through Oliver came across a diagram of the staff Lucas had given him, he stopped to read the text surrounding it.

```
I have fashioned this staff from the heartwood of a Elder tree at the center of the Shadow Lands. The wood is imbued with the enchantments that are so plentiful here and with whatever deep magic it can draw up through it's roots. I find that the staff can help guide me when I'm lost and it should aid me in finding my way to Andmore at last.
```

Oliver closed the book and grabbed the staff. He stood and rather than grip it tightly as he walked he tried to hold it loosely in front of him. Placing it out in front of him he found it seemed to pull him slightly to the left. Grabbing his backpack he set off letting the staff lead him. He found himself traveling out of the clearing by the pool on a downward slope as though heading away from the path, forturnately this time as he entered the forest the staff stayed with him, a good sign. After just a few steps he emerged from the trees back at the trail with the stream beneath his feet. It had worked! Oliver wasn't sure if the staff would lead him back to Andmore or if it would take him to Orless but he didn't care, it had saved him from being trapped forever by that pool and so he set off along the trail following the pull of the staff.
Now reinvigorated from his discovery of the staffs enchanted properties Oliver moved along the trail quickly, it was easy going, flat and largely free from roots and places to catch your foot. As he walked Oliver got to wondering how the trail had come to be. Lucas' journal hadn't mentioned a trail but clearly this one was well used. Did people travel through the shadow lands now more easily or was this trail for something else?
Lost in thought Oliver almost didn't notice the loud snap of a twig that signaled that something was ahead of him. Slowing down he proceeded as noiselessly as he could and coming around a small grove of trees he saw a large black cat bent over some sort of carcass. Before he could realize what was happening the cat stopped eating, raised its head and turned to look at Oliver. The cat was jet black like the color of the rock on the mountain here, from it's mouth 2 large fangs protruded, Oliver recognized the animal from one of the sketches he'd seen breifly in Lucas' notebook, a Shadow Cat. He hadn't had time to read the description but it was clear from a single look that the cat was a preditor, and from the look on the cat's face Oliver felt like he was pretty sure he looked like prey.
Turning and running Oliver heard a thump thump as the cat took up persuit. The staff in his hand seemed to pull Oliver off to his left and he quickly followed it pushing into the tree line. His arms stung suddently has he pushed into a throrny bush. Instinctively Oliver raised his arms up to protect his face ignoring the pain and pushed through the bush, then took another step and heard a loud cry right behind him. Free now from the thorny bush Oliver tried to run but tripped over a large root protuding from the ground. Catching himself as he landed he felt a sinking feeling as the ground he was on gave out and he slid off to his left down a large slope rolling and banging on rocks before he suddenly dropped closing his eyes and slamming his shoulder into a hard floor.

#Chapter 5. The Cave
When Oliver opened his eyes it was black. Not black like night or black like his eyes were closed but black like there was nothing. He was laying on his back on a cold hard floor, he could feel the bag uncomfortably underneath him and he still held the staff in his hand, but he couldn't see anything. Was he dead?
Reaching around Oliver found a smooth stone, slowly getting to his feet he felt walls behind and to either side, above him there was nothing, ahead a small passage not big enough to stand in. Not knowing waht else to do he started to crawl forward keeping a shoulder against a wall so he wouldn't get lost in the blackness. He crawled for what felt like hours, his legs and back getting sore from being hunched over on the ground however finally he noticed the space above his head opened up and he could stand. It was still pitch dark, so now standing and keeping one hand on the wall Oliver walked. He wasn't sure where he was going but Oliver had a feeling that he wasn't dead. The wall was rock, not jagged, but irregular like a cave. That's the most likely place he was Oliver thought. It was hard to tell without being able to see anything but the path he was following seemed to be decending slowly but surely.
Suddenly as Oliver took a step he found no ground beneth his foot, falling he reached out to catch himself and ended up grabbing at a large rock off to his right and dropping his staff, he didn't hear it hit the ground. Carefully regaining his footing Oliver slid his feet along the ground to feel out the space in front of him. To his horror the path he had been following seemed to become a narrow bridge of sorts. It was wide enough that he could walk on it easily but off to either side there seemed to be a drop. Laying on the floor and reaching down to either side Oliver wasn't able to find ground, in the darkness he couldn't know if the drop was a few feet or a bottomless pit. The walls he'd been using to guide him dropped away here so he'd have to cross the bridge to continue. What was worse than all this though is that the staff he'd been following so carefully seemed to be gone. Feeling around on the ground Oliver couldn't find it anywhere.
Without the staff Oliver felt lost, he couldn't see in the darkness and wasn't sure if he should turn around and look for other paths or if he should try to move forward and cross the bridge. Following the staff had led him here, surely going back was the wrong approach, but at the same time going forward without the staff would mean venturing into a complete unknown. Finally resolving that forward was the only path Oliver stepped forward on to the bridge. He wasn't afraid of heights, what his mother always said is that he was "appropriately" skeptical of them. As he stepped onto the bridge Oliver pretended like it was no more than a few feet off the ground, after all it may be, or it could be bottomless pit in which he would fall for the rest - shaking that thought from his head Oliver stepped, and nearly fell over. Without the wall to keep his hand on and anchor himself Oliver became disoriented, the room was so dark he couldn't tell which way was up or down. Feeling nausous he closed his eyes, took a breath and lay down with his belly on the bridge. The cold stone pressing against him helped him to regain his balance. Carefully he started to stand, and then thinking better of it stayed on all fours and started to crawl. It was hard going making sure he didn't accidentally crawl off the edge of the bridge, but it felt safer and so one arms length at a time he moved forward.
The bridge it turned out only crossed a small space, no longer than the length of his mom's car, still on all fours and trying not to fall to his death it took Oliver what felt like an hour to get across it. As he reached the other end he intially freaked out, the bridge seemed to end in a solid wall, reaching up though he felt the wall give way to floor and then reaching forward, wall. There was a staircase, and thankfully the walls on either side of the staircase would give Oliver something to ground himself to. A staircase meant that this cave wasn't just a cave but someplace. He still didn't know if this staircase would lead him out but being the only way forward, and a way off the bridge he pulled himself up and started to climb. The stairs started straight but then quickly turned into a tight spiral that wound their way up. He was reminded of the tower stair back in Andmore but rather than regular landings with rooms this one seemed to go on forever. After what felt like 5 full turns the wall Oliver was running his hand along turned from a smooth but uneven stone to rough carved blocks. He must have entered some sort of structure. Another 3 turns and a faint greenish glow began to filter into the stairs. The light was enough for Oliver to see that in fact the walls of the tower were made of large blocks of carved stone. Another turn and a half around the staircase and the room opened up into a large circular room.
The room resembled the one that Lucas inhabited at Castle Andmore, it was large and round, with 6 windows punctionating the walls. Through the windows a little light streamed through but outside the sky had the deep blue tenor of twighlight. Around the walls were bookshelves and tables covered with books, papers and various vials and liquids. In the center of the room a human figure stood hunched over a large table silloted by a green glow. The figure rose and turned, in the twighlight Oliver could see the face of an old woman, her face was sunken and pale, her long grey hair messy and frail, at first she seemed small but as Oliver watched her frame unfolded from a hunched posture to a tall and confident stance. She wore a long robe, similar to that of Lucas' but jet back. On her neck hung a pendant of what looked like Merstone, but Oliver noticed that the white veining on this stone was cracked and interrupted like someone had broken it. "I am the sorceress Valeria." The old womans voice seemed to be both booming and whisper quiet as though it was a statement meant only for Oliver, "and you do not belong in this world". With a flick of her wrist two tendrels of bright green light shot around her. Oliver saw a bright flash of green light and raised his hands to the shield his eyes.

#Chapter 6. The Old Castle
Oliver woke up and quickly threw his blanket off, he struggled for breath but reaching down and touching his chest he didn't see the rough spun hemp shirt he had worn in the shadow lands but rather the Pajamas with a car print mosaic that he'd put on before going to bed. More importantly where he expected a smoldering hole he chest seemed just damp from sweat. His clock read 5:30, it was morning but well before he should wake up and go eat breakfast, especially for a summer day. Instead he lay back down but maybe because he dreaded where he'd wake up, or maybe because he wasn't tired he avoided falling asleep.
The sun eventually streamed into his bedroom windows and Oliver was forced to accept that it was morning. Looking behind him he saw the jet black and white veined Merstone and next to it the pewter knight. That knight stirred something in Oliver, he got out of bed and nearly jumped down the stairs he was moving so fast, ate the breakfast his mother had made before wishing her well as she headed out to drop his little sister at day camp and go into work. Oliver had plans to meet up with Steven, arranged days before, but now he had new purpose, He got hurridly dressed, grabbed a wad of bills he'd been saving in the back of his underwear drawer, got on his bike and headed out.
Steven and Oliver met like they always did at the corner of the street that was about half-way between their houses, in reality it was far closer to Oliver's house than Steven's but when you factored in the geography of Frankie and Kevin's hosues, and you accounted for traffic this was the boys "half-way" point. Steven was a fairly introverted boy, he and Oliver had been friends since forever, it was Oliver who had befriended Kevin and Frankie, Steven got along fine with them but he and Oliver were inseperable. It was this lifelone friendship that put Oliver at-ease and let him tell Steven the events of the past few... days? night? Oliver wasn't quite sure. Steven for his part asked questions and tried to understand what exactly was happening but never once suggested that it was all "just a dream", after all if Oliver was convinced that he had traveled to another world then as far as Steven was concerned this must have happened.
As they talked Oliver lead the way on their bikes, he hadn't told Steven where they were going for fear that he may say no, atleast before hearing the whole story. Turning onto a gravel road that lead up a small hill Oliver heard Steven groan behind him "The castle?".
The large wooden sign near the corner of the road read "Diamandis Estate" but all the locals knew it as the castle. It was supposed to be a tourist attraction but no one ever seemed to come to visit it, rather it was something destined to be the least loved of school field trips and obligatory outings when family was visiting from out of town. Biking up the hill and around a curve Oliver couldn't believe his eyes, before him lay a red brick building not unlike a medieval castle, but what was striking to Oliver was that the shape of the building was exactly the same as the one he'd been in by the port of Andmore. "I knew it!" Oliver shouted, "What?" Steven asked out of breath from the ride. "This is the building I was in by the port!" Steven looked hesitantly at Oliver. "Are you sure it wasn't just a dream?" Steven finally seemed skeptical of the story he had heard. "I'm sure, come on!" Oliver parked his bike and beconned for Steven to do the same, seeing the hesitant look on his firend's face he said "Don't worry I'm paying." Oliver could tell by the way Steven's face lit up that he'd hit on the real problem. Steven may have been skeptical of Oliver's crazy adventure but he was more than happy to go along with it as long as it didn't cost him $3.50.
Upon entering the castle Oliver paid their admission with the cumpled up bills he had in his pocket, smoothing each one as he gave it to the cashier. The cashier for her part was skeptical of 2 12 year olds visiting the castle by themselves, probably tying to play at some mideval fantasy she thought, but ultimately they were the only visitors that had been all week so it wasn't like they would bother anyone. There was a standard speech that she she was supposed to give. "Gregory Diamandis immigrated to the US after making his fortune at a young age shipping throughout Asia and Africa. This building was constructed as a family home but the layout was based on the customs house at the harbour on Maadhad where he had been raised by his missionary parents. The building stayed in the family until Gregory's death when his son Robert decided to gift the building to the city for historical preservation". Oliver and Steven had head the speech before, the castle had been a 5th grade field trip, Oliver had also visited before, just before his Dad had left. Gregory Diamandis was some distant relation and his mother had memories of spending holidays with her family here as a child. He remembered that trip with his parents for happy moments, the last of those he had with all 4 of them. He remembered noticing that his mom was upset. He'd asked her why, and she said that the castle brought back some old memories but it had changed so much since she had spent time there.
As they entered a large receiving room with glass display cases along the walls Oliver turned to Steven whispering "This is exactly the same as the building in Andmore." "It's not from Andmore though, it's from Maadhad, you heard what the lady said". Oliver thought about this for a minute and glanced at the brochure that they'd been handed and then almost ran arond the room reading captions on various pictures. Coming back Oliver had a grin on his face. "Where does it say Maadhad?" Oliver asked Steven. Sighing Steven opened the guide pointing at the first page said "right here!" Together the two boys read carefully "...based on the customs house at the harbour where he had been raised by his missionary parents." "See", Oliver said "no mention of Maadhad anywhere." "But the lady at the de..." "Can you just trust me that this is definately the same building from Andmore. Here let me prove it to you." Oliver grabbed Steven's hand and started leading him into the room. "This was the main room where they'd conduct business, then back here to the left there's a small doorway," Oliver lead the way as he narrated the path he'd taken that night in Andmore climbing up to the city walls. "The doorway lead to a little courtyard. Then stairs, which go up." Reaching the second floor the boys path was blocked by a rope and a sign reading "Employees only beyond this point". "Well back in the city those stairs lead up to the city wall" Oliver added trying to be as convincing as possible. Steven seemed skeptical. Worried he was going to bail on him Oliver tried to change the subject. "Let's look around, maybe there's something here to help me figure out this enchantment." The second floor had a number of bedrooms that were labeled with brass paques by the doors. There was a blue room, a peone room, a forest room. Each room was decorated in accordance with its name. Each room had a small roped off area where you could enter and look around. As Oliver entered the peone room his jaw dropped and he quickly called for Steven. On the wall of the peone room was a framed faded map. The map showed the familiar cresent shaped island with filligreed writing above it "The Island of Alland" on the map Oliver could clearly see labeled the cities of Andmore, Orless, The Bay of Midwater, and in the southern something labled Inbrov.
"Look" Oliver pointed Steven at the map. "See I told you Andmore was real." For his part Steven remained skeptical, sure the map lined up with what Oliver had told him of Andmore, but right beneath it was a plaque labeling it "Fantasy map c. 1915". Steven examined the map, "What's that at the top?" he asked Oliver. Looking at the map Oliver saw the area that was clearly labeled Shadow Lands. Unlike the map in Lucas' study though this one didn't seem incomplete at the northern end. At the northern most tip of the map were illustrations of jagged rocks.
Steven and Oliver spent the rest of the morning exploring the castle but couldn't find anymore mentions of Andmore or the Island of Alland anywhere. Finally a bit afternoon they gave up the search and headed back to Steven's house for lunch. After Lunch Oliver wanted to discuss ways to break the enchantment. Steven seemed less interested in this than playing video games so after an hour or so Oliver headed out. Back at his house he dug out an old notebook from school that had some empty pages at the end. Turning to the first blank page he wrote in big block letters at the top "BREAKING THE ENCHANTMENT".
Several hours later Oliver heard his mom's car pull into the driveway. The page in front of him still sat blank. He left the notebook open and went downstairs. "Pizza and a movie?" His mom asked, she had a haggered look on her face. "Sure!" Oliver replied then after a second "Can I pick the movie?"
That night Oliver, Grace, and their mom relaxed on the sofa with pizza and the Lord of the Rigns. Before the movie was over Grace had fallen asleep on the sofa. As they cleared the dishes and packed up the left-overs his mom asked "So what did you get up to today?" "Steven and I went the castle." "The Castle..?" his mom let the word hang in the air not asking the question why. "You used to live there right?" Oliver asked, he knew that it wasn't true but he needed to learn more about the castle and he'd hoped if he'd get his mom talking he could ask the questions he really wanted to ask. "Ha" Oliver's mom gave a faint laugh, "No I never lived there, although I did grow up there in a lot of ways." She was quiet for a minute as though that was the end of the story but when Oliver just looked at her she kept going. "My great uncle, that's my grandfather's sister's husband was the one who built it. Gregory Diamandis, or just Grandpa Greg as I called him. He'd come to the this country without any family so when he met his wife and built the estate he'd sort of adopted her family, her older brother - my grandfather and grandmother were always welcome, and there was lots of room. Now my dad - your grandpa he was there practically every weekend when he was younger, playing with his cousins. He and your grandma had me when they were pretty young. They were trying to have a family and a career, but my grandmother had died recently and my grandfather wasn't up to taking care of a toddler. So I often ended up spending time with my great aunt and great uncle while your grandparents tried to build their life. At the time Gregory's children had mostly moved out or were away at school but didn't have family of their own so I was a defacto grandchild for him." His mom trailed off again and Oliver gave her the space with her thoughts for a minute "But you had to stop going when they made it a meuseum?" he asked. "No, no... long before that. I got a bit older, and my parents had their little business in town so I didn't have to get dropped off quite so much. Then Grandpa Greg's children had children of their own - your Uncle Billy and Uncle Mark. Then my Grandpa Bill and my Great Aunt Grace died within a year of each other. At that point I think your grandparents didn't feel quite as welcome as they used to at the estate." "Gregory kicked them out?!" Oliver asked incredulously. "No not kicked out, but you see Grandpa Greg he loved me very much, but his connection to your grandparent was through his wife and her brother. They had died and Gregory was getting old so he decided to focus his efforts on his own grandchildren - given the choice. It's actually funny, it was only a few years, maybe 3, between your Uncle Billy was born and the when we really stopped going to the estate. We'd still go for Christams since it was the family tradition for so long." "Do you know how your Grandpa Greg got money to build the castle, it must have been expensive" "I'm sure it was vary expensive, he never told me, just that it had something to do with shipping. Although I get a sense it wasn't entirely legal. You know he never stepped foot on a boat after he came here, he would always say 'If I take to the sea I'm worried she'll take me back and not let go this time'", Oliver saw what he thought was an opening. "And your Grandpa Greg, where was he from?" "Oh some island, I think it was somewhere small and... well... wherever" By now Oliver had finsiehd putting away the dishes so he asked the one question he couldn't think of any other way ask. "Grandpa Greg, was he from Maadhad or Andmore?" "No. At least I don't think he was from Maadhad, but maybe he was" his mom said, "Although I think if you'd asked Grandpa Greg he'd love to have been from Andmore. He would always tell us stories at bed time about that place. He was especially fond of the adventures of James the Pirate king. Speaking of which it's long past your bedtime."
When logic, "but it's summer", and pleading, "please I'm not tired" didn't work out Oliver resigned himself to bed. Sitting alone in his room and haveing pushed aside his old school notebook Oliver started to think of ways he could learn more about his great-grand uncle. In part in order to avoid finding out exactly what had become of his body back in the shadow lands. But before he could come up with an ingeniuous plan Oliver started to nodd off and fell alseep.

#Chapter 7. The Pirate King
Oliver awoke to the crashing sound of surf. He blinked his eyes open in the not too bright sun and looked up. What he saw was a tower of dizzying height and felt instantly nausious. Oliver rolled onto his stomach to keep from vomiting, but ultimately nothing came out. Standing he noticed the tower was built from the same black rocks that jaggedly poked up from around him. He was standing in the narrow space between 2 particularly large rocks that blocked most of his view, beneath his feet was damp black sand that looked like it had been made from the same jet black rock that seemed to be everywhere on... Alland, that was the name of the island that was on the map at the castle back in his world. Suddenly Oliver's stomache turned again, this time not from nauseua but hunger, He wasn't sure how long he'd spent in Alland without eating but he'd have to eat eventually right? Just then as-if he'd summoned it a wiff of barbacue drifted across the sea air. Grabbing his bag and scrambling up the large black rocks Oliver got to a better vantage point. He was near the base of the tower which seemed to rise from rocks that were all around him. The tower stood right at the edge of the forest and from here Oliver could look up to where the top of the mountain dissapeared into clouds. The smell of cooking was coming from close by, and looking carefully along the rocky landscape Oliver saw the faint curl of smoke raising up from between two of the larger rocks that were near the sea. Carefully he made his way along the rocks until he reached the place where the smoke was. Looking down he saw a small cook fire with fish roasting over a spit, it seemed abandoned. Sliding down the rock and dropping to the black sand Oliver made his way to the cook fire to see if the fish was ready to eat. "Hold it right there!" a voice said from behind him. Turning Oliver saw a man in ragged clothes holding a sword pointed at him. "A thief!" another voice said, Oliver turned again to find another man, with the same storm tossed look about him. "Let's take him to captain" this time a third man stepped into view from behind a rock. "I just wanted some food" Oliver pleaded. "Save it!" the first man said, one of the other men grabbed him by the arms, grabbed his bag, and quickly tied his hands behind his back. Oliver was sat down on the wet sand and had to watch as the three men quickly consumed the fish and quickly rifled through his bag. After eating they dragged him along a path between stones until they reached a small boat pulled up on a protected beach, loading him in they pushed off and started to row.
The small boat seemed to make little progress against the waves coming in to the shore. A thick layer of fog hung close to the sea just off shore where the boat was headed, what was waiting in the fog Oliver couldn't be sure. One of the men climbed past Oliver to the front of the boat and rang a small bell there "Ring... Ring Ring... Ring". Summoned by the bell a ship seemed to appear from out of the fog. It wasn't overly large, 2 masted and seemd to sit squatly on the the water tipping a little as it turned. Coming up along side the boat Oliver could see the name "Shadow Run" written on the side. The man at the front of their boat tossed a line up to the deck and a rope ladder was lowered. One of the men pulled a large knife from his belt, stared dangerously at Oliver then turned him around and cut his hands free. The implication was that he should be climbing and not thinking about escape. On the boat a small crew were assembled tending to the lines preparing a winch to raise the rowboat out of the sea. One man stood out amongst the crew, he wasn't the tallest but he held himself well, his red hair and wispy red mustache he had that same storm mangled look, but his clothes had clearly once been much nicer. Stepping forward he asked the man holding Oliver's arm a question "Who is this?" "Thief," the man replied "caught him trying to steal our lunch while we were patrolling down by the rocks captain". "What is your name thief?" the captain asked "Oliver, and please - captain - I'm not a thief I'm just hungry." Oliver answered. The captain gave a wide grin and then launched into a speach, clearly rehersed but rusty, "I am Nicolas Aetos, King of Pirates. This is my ship Shadow Run and you, Oliver, are welcome as my guest so long as you prove profitable. You see we pirates don't mind thiefs so much, as long as they're not taking from us." With the last words Nicolas gave a laugh, turned and said "Bring him to my cabin, I wish to talk to him" Oliver was escorted quickly behind Nicolas to a door near the aft of the ship and taken inside through a hallway to a cramped cabin at the rear of the ship. The room itself was just big enough for a small bed, a table and some book shelves. Oliver was sat at the table, Nicolas sat opposite him and took Oliver's bag as it was handed to him. "Let's see what we have here" Nicolas said emptying the contents of Oliver's bag on the table as his men left the room. "Ah, I see you've met Lucas" Nicolas had leafed open the journal with one hand and was playing with one of the vials of clear liqid with the other "So tell me Oliver, where are you from and why are you here?". Oliver decided it may be best to keep his story simple so he recounted the tale of the attack on Andmore, and his journey through the shadow lands, he left out the bit about going back to his world after the run-in with Valeria. As he started to describe being captured by Nicolas's men the pirate king waved his hand and said "Enough" he stood up and and looked down at Oliver. "I'm not sure if keeping you here will be profitable to me or cost me greatly but for now you may stay confined to my cabin, you may have the journal but I will keep the potions." Nicolas put the potions he'd been fidiling with back in Olivers bag, and taking the bag but leaving the journal he left the room locking the door behind him.
Oliver sat nervously for a moment but then realizing that he was trapped and may as well make the best of it he opened the journal, flipping through the second half. Here he found a drawing of a small deer like animal labeled "Shadow Deer" - Lucas was pretty unoriginal at naming it turned out - the description talked about how it's coat was imbued with the same enchantments that the streams possessed, this allowed the deer to hide in plain sight from predators. Oliver found the entry on Shadow Cats again, this time reading the description it found it mostly full of warnings, Lucas he surmised may be crazy but he wasn't so crazy that he wanted to study the animals. Suddently remembering earlier words in the journal Oliver flipped back to the last page of Lucass adventure log and read the passage.

```
Alas I must give up home my Valeria she has been taken by The Shadow and is a lost cause. I'm tempted to give myself to the same fate to be trapt here with her, but I know that if I'm lost too then we'll be apart forever. All I can do now is find my way at last to Andmore. I must continue to avoid enchantments and trust that there's enought magic in this forest to save me from the horrors.
```

Oliver turned back to the previous entry

```
My poor Valeria, I know that her heart is good and she will overcome the darkness but everytime she uses her skills to enchant she opens herself up to letting a little more in. She knows this of-course and if it were just her she would likely die rather than turn to The Shadow, but today she was forced to sheild us from one of those cats. Had I been paying attention I may have been able to fend it off without her but I was so lost in my own head that I didn't hear the animal coming. I've told her to remove her Merstone amulet - it would leave her unable to enchant but it would also break the anchor The Shadow has on her. She's worried of how fragile a balance it holds inside though. For my part my amulet doesn't seem so close to breaking so I've decided to remove it rather than risk my own demise.
```

Skimming through the book Oliver read bits and pieces of passages finding at-last one that caught his interest.

```
I can't believe I'm writing this, my Valeria has been found, or I suppose more correctly she's found me. I had feared that my delay in finding a way though the forest would lead to her losing faith, but I never expected it would lead to her journing into the forest to rescue me. I can take comfort that now we're reuinited we shall never be apart. Althought this will be cold comfort if we meet our own demise in this forest.
```

Oliver was interrupted by the door unlocking, he closed the book and pretended to be interested in the wall of the room. The door swung open and Nicolas entered. "I've decided that you shall be profitable to me!" Nicolas annouced upon entering, "You see the sorceress in that tower has trapt us here, we sail away and find that we just end up back at the shore. If you wish to find your way out of this forest and make your way to Orless then you must defeat her." Oliver thought about this for a minute. "What if I can't?" he asked, "Well then," Nicolas smiled "you'll die or you'll be cursed, either way you won't be welcome on my boat and I'll be just as trapt as I am today." "But if I do defeat her you'll take me to Orless?" Oliver asked. "God no!" Nicolas seemed shocked "If Lucas was right and the Merfolk are after you I can't have you in my boat anywhere near their lands. I've made my name and fortune being smart enough to avoid them." Reluctantly Oliver shook his head in agreement "Ok, I'll do it!" he said although he had no idea how, maybe he thought by removing the merstone amulet she wore, although why wouldn't Lucas have done that at the very end, it seemed so simple. "Very good" said Nicolas, "In that case you'll need your strength, come, eat and drink with my crew and I for in the morning you go on your own"
Sitting on the deck of the Shadow Run Oliver joined the crew in a feast of fishes and meats, seaweeds and mushrooms. There was a drink a yellowish color, sweet but Oliver assumed a bit alcholoic, still it helped to quench his thirst. After the meal the men told stories of exploits, fighting mermen and wooing mermaids. As well as stories that were clearly fabrications about cursed treasure and ghosts. As the night wore on Oliver asked Nicolas "Why do you call yourself King of the pirates?" "Ah!" Nicolas said, standing and launching into a tale.
"Many many generations ago Alland was the kingdom of the pirates. We plundered the ships that sailed on the sea and beneath it bringing our silver back to Alland to hide in the caves along the island's shore. One day the Pirate King decided that he was done plundering and stealing. True power he thought would come from a kingdom all his own. So he took his ships to the depths and found the Merking and struck up a deal. The pirates would no longer plunder the merfolk and would give up their ability to travel underwater. The Merfolk for their part would support the King in his claim to rule the world above the sea. So it was that pirate boats became unable to travel underwater, and so it was that the Pirate King dragged his largest ship ashore on Kings rock and made it his castle. But the Merfolk feeling they'd been wronged for years by pirates raiding their cities and ships had laid a trap. When the Pirate Kings fleet started to sail out of the bay they found a chain lay just beneath the surface blocking the narrow entrance. When they tried to break the chain the men were set on by Merfolk soliders and drowned. Furious the Pirate King demanded to speak to Merking. Raising from the sea the Merking reminded the Pirate King of their deal, the chain was not above the water, and so was the domain of the Merfolk. Defeated the Pirate King returned to his castle and sat on his throne. Since that time the rulers of Andmore and Orless have been content to sit on their thrones and look only at the little bay in front of them. But we pirates name amongst ourselves King one who has managed to make it past the Merfolk, into the open sea, and return. For truely all the sea is the kingdom of pirates!" Finishing the story the crew let our cheers. Sitting Nicolas added "Now Master Oliver, it is time to retire for the night. Tomorrow you must free us all of this sorcery" begudgingly Oliver got up, but before he left he asked "Have you ever heard of a James the Pirate King?" "James... no, the last Pirate King before me was a man named Gregory Diamandis but that was many years ago and he died a sea" With that Nicolas went back to racous story telling with his men it was clear that it was time for Oliver to depart.
On his way back to a bunk that he'd been given Oliver couldn't let the last words of captain Nicolas out of his head. Gregory Diamandis was a pirate king, was it possible that he had sailed beyond the bay and somehow reached Oliver's world? None of it really made sense but if it was possible Oliver wondered if he could break the spell the same way, by sailing between the worlds? At last reaching his bunk Oliver lay down thinking about all that he'd learned today and the impossible task ahead of him tomorrow. With a full stomache, and a little drunk Oliver quickly fell alseep.

#Chapter 8. The Cove
The next morning Oliver awoke and headed out on deck. The Shadow run was anchored in a shallow cove lined with dense jungle. The black tower loomed nearby. On the deck men were lowering the rowboat into the water, this Oliver realized would be taking him off the boat and the last time he'd have the company of these pirates. Looking around the cove Oliver saw something unexpected floating in the water. There not unlike a piece of driftwood but isntantly recognizable was his staff. "Hey" he cried out "I need that staff!" The men lowering the boat looked at him oddly. "To defeat the sorceress!" Oliver added, understanding one of the men grabbed a grappling hook from nearby and fished the staff up out of the water handing it to Oliver. Looking it over confirmed that this was the same staff he'd been given by Lucas back in Andmore, holding it loosely in his hand it did seem to pull him towards the tower, something he had dreaded. While relishing the seemingly miraculous return of his staff Nicolas appeared on the deck holding Oliver's pack and what looked the a blanket. He stretched out the blanket and Oliver realized immediately that it was the skin of one of those Shadow Deer. "Illusives we call them," Nicolas said "They're good at hiding but we can trap them and when we do their pelts make good cloakes for our scouts. Wear one of these and you can hide almost anywhere." Nicolas handed Oliver the pelt and his bag and then gestured to some of his men "Good Luck, Oliver of Andmore, may you free us all from this curse or die trying". With that Nicolas left and Oliver was left with no option but to go ashoore in the rowboat with some of the crew.
The men pulled the rowboat up onto the beach in the cove and staked it into the sand. Two of the men set off into the forest, "Hunting party" the other man remarked, "But this is where you're leaving us!" he added as though it needed to be said. Oliver held his staff lightly and followed it away from the boat along the beach. Off to one side of the cove a stream ran out of the forest and cut through the beach, here the staff seemed to want to turn and pull Oliver upstream, obligingly Oliver followed. The stream wound it's way through the forest, the cannopy completely blocked out the view of the tower and so left Oliver blind to knowing if he was headed the right way or not. As he got deeper into the forest Oliver came through some partiuclarly dense branches to suddenly find himself staring at a shadow cat drinking from the stream. He stood perfectly still but the Shadow cat didn't seem to notice him, or didn't seem to mind. It finished drinking and headed out. Thank god for the pelt, Oliver thought. Further upstream Oliver came to a pond, here the water flowed quickly out of a cave in the sheer rock cliff to make a misty waterfall and collect before running down to the sea. In the clearing Oliver could see that he was nearly at the base of the tower. The pool was deep and cool to the touch, and Oliver was thirsty but he thought better than to drink the water fearing he'd get lost again.
Holding the staff out in front of him loosely in his hand Oliver felt it pull towards the waterfall. Nervously he surveyed the black rocky cliffs, They seemed smooth at first but getting closer Oliver could see that the rock had small grooves here and there along the face and just above his head he could see a small ledge. He took off his bag, tied the stap around the staff and then reshouldered the bag. Carefully he reached up and grabed the rock and then taking a breath pulled up and used the grooves to scramble his way up to the ledge. On the Ledge Oliver pressed his chest to the cliff face infront of him and inched his way along, atlast making his way to the cave-like entrance where the water flowed from. Here the ledge continued inside the cave widening so he could stand easily, a odd result of past errosion maybe? Walking along the ledge Oliver entered the cave and was quickly pitched into complete darkness. After rounding a bend and continuing along the ledge his hand felt something obstructing his path. It was stone, about 2 feet tall and jutted out of the wall about 4 feet high feeling along it he started to get a sense for its shape and then realized. The bridge! This is where he'd lost his staff before, this is where the stairs to the tower started! Oliver pulled himself up to the bridge found the start of the stairs and started to climb.
Knowing what to expect Oliver was still unsure of what he was about to do. It was broad daylight outside but still from the staircase Oliver could tell that bairly any light was entereing the room at the top of the tower. He knew the moment he entered the room a powerful sorceress would want to do something to stop him, but he also knew that it was Valeria and that she'd been corrupted and it had something to do with her merstone amulet. Finally summoning all the courage he could muster Oliver took the last half turn of the stairs as quickly as he could and entered the large round chamber. The old woman was standing as before at the center of the room hunched over something green. Oliver tried to stay off to the side of the room and circle to get a better view of her but as he did she turned and said "Silly traveler, if you won't stay out of my way then you must die!" With that she waved her arms. Oliver ducked, closing he eyes, but the burst of green energy flew off in a different direction. The cloak, it had worked again to keep him safe. Valeria screamed, "I see you've met up with those annoying pirates!". Feeling invicible under his cloak Oliver quickly kept moving around the outside of the room. Away from the stair case the heavy bookcases and tables seemed like they may offer something to hide behind. Valeria spun about firing off green blasts wildly, they slammed into walls chipping stone, smashed into bookshelves sending papers flying, and crashed through glass on the tables. A few of the blasts came close to Oliver but he kept his head down and finally stopped under a large heavy table. Croaching Oliver watched blast after blast with Valeria getting increasingly frustrated at being unable to find her mark. At last she screamed, slamming her hands down on the table. All of a sudden Oliver felt an opressing feeling like all of the air had been sucked out of the room. Looking around Oliver made eye contact with the sorceress the wry smile on her face revealed the she could see him too. Oliver waited for the flash of green that would mean his death but it didn't come, instead Valeria grabbed the heavy glass decanter, brandishing it like a club and in the process dumping a thick green liquid all over the floor. Quickly she approached Oliver placing herself between the staircase and him, it was clear that if he was going to escape it was going to be through her. Oliver stayed croached beneath the heavy table, looking for any way to save himself. Reaching the table Valeria croached and swung the decanter at Oliver, but she was offbalance and Oliver easily fell backwards to avoid the wild swing. Seeing the table above him Oliver had an idea, planting his feet on the bottom of the table he kicked up with all the force he could muster. The table was heavy but it was also covered in heavy books and equipment, as the table tipped these slid and put the table out of balance and added to the push Oliver had given it. With a crash the table tipped over onto it's side, Valeria was knocked back and Oliver stoood, now with a short wall between himself and the sorceress, but it was a shortlived victory, Valeria was quickly on her feet placing her free hand on the upturned table she leaned into it and wound up with the decanter to bring it crashing into Oliver. In a split second Oliver saw the damaged merston amuluet dangling from Valeria's neck, he took a step forward and grabbed it. The amulet burned Oliver's hand as it closed around it but before he could let go the decanter slammed into his back, knocking the wind out of him as he fell to the ground. He had kept his grip on the amulet and as he fell the chain broke away from Valeria's neck. Valeria screamed. As Oliver hit the ground he dropped the amulet and the merstone shattered. Suddenly the tower shuttered and the sun shone into the windows as if blinds had been opened. Valeria collapsed. Oliver wasn't sure what to do, standing he circled around the table and reached down to Valeria to check on her. She was still breathing but she was shivvering all over as though she was cold even though the room felt quite warm. After a minute she opened her eyes and looked at Oliver with a stern face "What have you done?" she asked, "I freed you" Oliver answered trying not to sound too proud of doing what Lucas couldn't. "No you doomed us both" Valeria said worry in her voice, "Come quickly" She stood seemed to shake off the chill she'd had and lead the way back to the stairs. Oliver followed trying to keep pace with the woman as she seemed to glide down the stairs. Reaching the bridge Oliver noticed that it wasn't so dark anymore and he could clearly see now the bridge only a few feet above the slowly flowing river. Valeria didn't slow at all and crossed the bridge at a run. Oliver was less sure of his footing and tried to take it a bit slower until about half-way across he lost his balance and fell with a splash into the water. He tried to swim for the edge but found the current moving too switfly and all of a sudden he was looking at the bright light coming in from the cave mouth and...
Oliver took a deep breath as he was pulled over the water fall and plunged into the pool below. He felt his feet slam into the rocky bottom but it was deep enough that he was unharmed. Pushing off and raising to the surface he emerged and quickly swam off to the side and pulled himself out. Tired and out of breath Oliver decided he'd had enough adventure for one day, grabbing his staff he followed the stream back to the cove where he expected to find the Shadow Run. To his dismay the pirates were gone, but they'd left behind the embers of a cook fire. Grabbing some sticks from the forest Oliver was able to get a small fire going and start to dry off from his unintentional swim. Looking into the bag Oliver found that there was food that Nicolas had given him, dried meats and berries, and a flask of dark yellow liquid. The food had gotten a little soggy but still it was food, Oliver figured if he was careful he could stretch this to 3 maybe 4 days worth. Looking up at the mountain he would have to climb and the forest he would have to brave he wasn't sure it would be enough. Miraculously Lucas' journal was dry, probably an enchantment of some kind. The vials were wet but otherwise undamaged. Replacing the food and vials in his bag Oliver settled down by the fire and started to read Lucas' journal as night set-in.
That night as he lay sleeping on the beach of the cove Oliver had a dream of his monther and sister. They were playing at the playground by their house when suddenly a looming shadow came and swollowed up everythign in darkness. Oliver awoke with a start to see Valeria standing over him.
"Get up, we need to leave!" Valeria demanded. duitfully Oliver followed her, collecting his things as she kicked sand on the fire to put it out. Valeria lead the way along the beach as though she knew where she was going. Oliver grasped his staff loosely feeling it's pull got the sense that it wanted to follow her and so he did. They reached a small path that looked like it was used for game, or hunting, and Valeria turned to Oliver and said "Stay close, and try not to fall this time" with that she entered the trail and started off at nearly a run. Oliver had to really run to keep up, although he was worried he would trip and fall again if he went too fast. After a ways along the game trail Valeria veered off to the left and pushed through the forest. There beyond the trees at the base of a rocky outcropping was a shallow cave, Valeria gestured to the cave entrance and said "We'll spend the night here"

#Chapter 9. The Sorceress
In the fading light Oliver sat down in the cave and watched as Valeria frantically gathered pale blue stones and bright yellow flowers. The flowers she sprinkled around the opening to the cave, the stones she stacked neatly by the entrance. As she did this she muttered to herself although Oliver couldn't make out what she was saying. Reaching into his bag and grabbing Lucas' journal Oliver flipped to the second half and found a drawing of the flowers.

```
Sun Lilys
These grow wild in thorny vines throughout the forest. The vines themselves seem to be enchanted with a light energy. The thorns are especially painful to the Shadow cats when they scratch them, as such they avoid the vines and the flowers themselves at all costs. Even picked the flowers can provide a way to ward off Shadow cats, the safest way to spend the night is to ensure you're covered in the flowers.
```

Oliver started to look for the rocks, but being that the only distinguising characteristic was their color and Lucas had written in black ink it was hard to tell. While still flipping through the book Valeria came over to his side. "I see you've met Lucas" she said mockingly. "Yes" Oliver answered looking up at her face. Seeing her strained expression and remembering the look of grief on Lucas' face as he talked about the Shadow Land Oliver added, "he loves you and misses you". "Did he tell you that?" Valeria asked, not waiting for Oliver to answer added "Never mind, I know the answer. He may think he loves me but it's easy to love someone you've lost." Darkness was falling fast, Valeria grabbed a handful of the blue stones and took them to the back of the cave. She started to bang 2 of the stones together, Oliver wondered if she was trying to make a fire, but to his amazement the stones started to glow a faint blue. Adding more of the stones one at a time she was able to build a pile of them about the size of a basketball that growed a soft blue light. It wasn't blinding but it gave them enough light to see their surroundings clearly. "You know all about me from that book I reccon" Valeria said, "Why don't you tell me your story." Oliver looked over at her with a look of exhaustion, what he wanted more than anything else was for Valeria to explain how to stop coming to this world. "I can see you're tired of telling your story" Valeria remarked, "Why don't I tell it for you?"
"Let's see" Valeria began, "You found the travel stone in your world, not knowing what it was you bonded with it. Then all of a sudden you found yourself transported to the Kingdom of Andmore where you met the sorcerer Lucas. The merfolk attacked Andmore and Lucas sent you on a path through the shadow lands to Orless with instructions to find the guild and break the enchantment. On the way you got waylaid and ended up in my tower, then met up with a band of pirates who asked you to break an enchantment for them. Thats when you returned to my tower, broke my amulet and now we're here." pausing Valeria asked "How did I do?" "Amazing" was Oliver's response, "did you use magic to know all that?" "No" Valeria said with a laugh "I used logic and what I know of Lucas to know all that, do you want me to explain?" "Yes, please I feel like there's so much I don't know about this world". "Fist, the one thing I don't know, what is your name?" Valeria asked, "Oliver", "Ok Oliver, I could tell from your aura back at the tower that you were from another world. The only way to travel between worlds is the travel stone. Gergor's diary and what you said about him still loving me, that tells me that you met him in Andmore. Lucas would have tried to help you. You see I loved him greatly once but his desire to help others, and his estimation of his skill in doing so is his downfall. The only reason he'd send you away from Andmore is if it wasn't safe for you to be there. That means that the Merfolk are after you. Lucas' decision to send you through the shadow lands and not over the water when the water is safer and the fact that those pirates didn't wait for you to get back from breaking the enchantment confirms that it's the Merfolk who are after you." no less confused Oliver asked "Can you help me?" "No" Valeria answered bluntly "well at least, not in the way you'd want. You see Lucas thought to send you to the guild in Orless dispite his hatred for them because there are sorcerers there who can break the enchantment of a merstone. That's how our amulets," Valeria touched the spot on her neck where her amulet had been and paused for a moment, "That's how our amulet's are made. We remove the enchantment from the stones and leave behind a void that we can use to amplify our own powers. As skilled as I am I do not pocess the knowledge of how to do this, and what's more you don't have the stone in this world so even if I did I'd be powerless to help you. What I can do, all I can do, is get you out of the Shadow Lands and see you safely to the outskirts of Orless, from there you're on your own."
Oliver sat for what felt like an eternity mulling over what Valeria had said. "Can I ask you a question?" Oliver asked, "Sure", "Back at the tower you said that I'd doomed us both, what did you mean by that?" Valeria sighed - "I'd hoped you'd forgotten, it's not your battle to fight and I don't want to put anything more on your shoulders". "I had a dream after I left the tower," Oliver said, "a shadow consumed my mother and sister." Valeria considered this for a moment, "Do you travel to this world when you fall alseep in yours?" "Yes"... "Oliver, sometimes a dream is just a dream." With that Valeria stood and kicked over the pile of blue stones, they kept glowing but grew fainter and started to dim. "Time to get some sleep" she added laying down on the hard dirt floor. Oliver did the same staring up that the cave ceiling and thinking about how he could break the enchantment that had trapped him in this land. He slept restlessly that night and had another nightmare where shadows consumed his mom and sister, then they started to consume Stephen and Frankie, and his whole town.
The next two days passed with no incident and little to no conversation. During the day they'd walk along the various well worn trails that the deer and cats had left in the forest. They'd stop in the evening to forage for food, make camp and sleep. At night Oliver always dreamed about shadows growing over his world. As they walked Oliver had tried to ask Valeria questions, the answers were often short and to-the-point. "How did Merstone's work?" "No one knows", "How do you become a sorcerer?" "Practice and a bit of natural skill, oh and a merstone amulet", "Why do the Merfolk keep people trapt on the island?" "We don't know, there are stories but the oldest books in the libraries of Andmore and Orless say that it's always been that way.", "What happens to my body here when I travel back to my world?" "It ceases to exist, you don't really have a body here just a physical projection", "What is The Shadow?" to this there was no answer. To occupy his time at night Oliver turned to Lucas' journal and started to read about what had happened with Lucas and Valeria had been in the shadow lands together. Lucas' writing was sometimes in-frequent and had strayed from being an attempt at a historical account of his travels to more an outlet for stray thoughts. Still from what Oliver was able to piece together Lucas had spent the better part of 6 months lost in the Shadow lands trying to find a way between Andmore and Orless. Oliver remembered what Valeria had said about Lucas - he over estimated his skill - it seems like the plan for Lucas to travel through the Shadow lands was last minute and not one Valeria had agreed to, so finding herself on a diplomatic trip to Andmore and her lover having run off from the guild she defected to Andmore and hoped for the best for Lucas. When he didn't come out of the forest for months she set off to rescue him. She'd found him quickly enough but there was something about her that the shadow land found quite appealing. Whatever forces where at play in this place they seemed to place obstacle after obstacle in the way of Lucas and Valeria leaving. So months had passed and darkness had started to take hold of Valeria. Oliver still didn't understand the Merstones, but Valeria had described the amulets the sorcerers wore as hollowed out, amplifiers. He imagined them like a cup, drinking from one during a warm summer day is a nice but if it's pouring rain then it's a different story. Everytime Valeria or Lucas did an enchantment they opened up the merstone in their amulet to all the energy that was flowing around them, and everytime just a little bit seeped in. It was Valeria who had realized the risk, by then Lucas had been in the Shadow lands for almost 10 months. They stopped using enchantments whenever possible and started to learn to survive using the forset itself. It was Valeria's idea to make a encyclopedia, starting from the back of the diary, "we'll be free when your diary entries met in the middle" she'd said one night according to Lucas. Oliver looked at the back for the first entires, all the various nuts and berries they'd been eating. Food it seemed was a good place to start. Oliver got the sense that perhaps Valeria knew that she wouldn't be able to leave the forest, and was giving Lucas a guide, the tools he'd need to make it out without her. By his reconning Lucas had left Valeria roughly where the tower now stood almost a year after he had first entered the shadow lands. After leaving her behind it took him only 5 days to escape. The Shadow land didn't want him, it wanted her, and it had gotten what it wanted. Oliver asked Valeria if Lucas had every come back looking for her. "No, although he does come back now and then. He needs to collect supplies for his labratory in Andmore and He'd hoped to build his own sorcerers guild in there, evening the playing field. He tried to cut a secret path between the cities that could be safely traveled by defecting sorcerers. He did travel along the path several times, but none of the sorcerers seemed interested in switching to Lucas' side and so his dreams of a second guild were ended."
On the third day the trail they were following leveled off and intersected another trail that ran perpendicular. Valeria crouched down and felt along the ground and then gestured to Oliver "The staff!" She held the staff at the intersection of the trails and then let it go. The staff spun in place once, twice, then a third wobbly spin before dropping off to the left. "As I feared" she said picking up the staff, handing it back to Oliver and leading them off to the right. "We've been followed since we left the tower" Valeria said, "a few shadow cats that I'd hoped I could shake, but now it's seems we're surrounded." "What do you mean surrounded?" Oliver asked. "I mean there are Shadow cats on all sides of us waiting to make a move" Valeria said. Just off the trail a sun lily vine had grown up around a tree, Valeria grabed the vine, wincing from the pain of the thorns and tore off a heavy section of it. The vine was flimsy but seemed almost whip like in Valeria's hand. "Better than nothing" she said noticing Oliver's skeptism. It wasn't much forther along the trail when the first shadow cat struck.
Oliver didn't see it until it was in the air flying towards Valeria, he screamed and Valeria turned and whipped the sun lily vine around just in time. The cat slammed into her arm, knocking her off balance for a second but the lashing from the vine had clearly hurt the shadow cat. Regaining her balance Valeria came at the cat swinging the vine and landing a blow across it's face. The shadow cat let out a yelp and ran off to go lick it's wounds. Valeria didn't bother to chase the cat, instead without speaking she broke into a run along the trail and Oliver had to run after her to catch up.

#Chapter 10. The Climb
The trail they were following ended at a sheer cliff. "Go" Valeria yelled, it took Oliver a moment to realize that crude steps had been carved into the cliff so he started to climb. After getting a ways off the ground he looked back to see Valeria, standing back to the wall and rummaging in her pocket. "Come on!" Oliver yelled, trying to understand why she wasn't climbing. "I said go!" was Valeria's response. "You want me to leave you?" Oliver wasn't sure if his shock was from leaving her alone in the forest, or not having her to help him any further. "Just keep climbing, follow the path at the end and you'll be in Orless before nightfall" Valeria said, looking up at Oliver she added, "You read the diary, you know I was never meant to leave this place." with that Valeria turned away and Oliver started to climb.
It only took a few minutes for Oliver to clear the tree line, he could see now that his was climbing a steep cliff along the edge of the mountain. The climb seemed to go on forever and below him he could hear what sounded like shouting and crying. He strained to tell if it was the cry of a cat getting hit with thornes or the cry of a person getting eaten, but whenerver he stopped to listen he found all he could hear was the heavy beat of his heart and whistling of the wind, he didn't dare to look back. At last he came to the end of the climb, along the thin ridgeline ran a worn trail snaking it's way downhill and curving around the mountain. Oliver started the path at a run but realized quickly that there were loose stones and if he tripped and fell he'd be dead. Slowing to a brisk walk he quickly rounded the corner and for the first time since leaving Andmore saw the Bay of Midwater stretched out in front of him. Oliver stopped for a moment to get his bearings. The moutain blocked his view of most of Andmore, but he could see what appeared to be farmland off to that side. Across the bay the city of Orless. It was built in a raveen long, and narrow with high stone walls to either side. Unlike Andmore it was more centrally located on this side of the island. Outside of the raveen the hills surrounding it seemed to be covered with terraced farms. In the distance he thought he could make out the narrow entrance to the bay, that must be where the chain guarding the harbour lays, thought Oliver. Up ahead the trail curved back so he could clearly see the shadow lands behind him. The forest covered the side of the mountain down till it broke along the rocky northern tip of the island. Just barely visible against the rocky backdrop was the tower, it seemed like such a long distance to have traveled in so short a time. That was when it happened.
Oliver suddenly saw a bright flash of yellow where the forest met the mountain, from where he had left Valeria. It looked like the flash that Lucas had set off to illuminate the night back in Andmore but a thousand times brighter. Then a shockwave and deep boom seemed to spread out across the forest. From up on the ridge line Oliver felt a faint rumbling and saw Dark Ravens leave their tree tops roosts. The shockwave reached all the way down the mountain and Oliver watched in amazement as the tower shook and all of a sudden collapsed. Valeria had hinted that she was a powerful sorcerer but from what Oliver knew of enchantments this should have been impossible without her merstone amulet. Still as the shock cleared the Dark Ravens returned to their roosts and the forest fell silent. Not wanting to linger on what it all meant Oliver continued along the path as quickly as he could.
Eventually the path dipped back into the forest, but this time it was on the inner bay-side of the island, the "safe side" as Oliver liked to think if it. Suddently the path ended, the branches of a thick bush blocking the way. Pushing through Oliver saw a sunny field beyond took a step out and fell into darkness.

#Chapter 11. The Orange Grove
Oliver found himself in the shaded cannopy of a large trellace. Wooden beams came out of the ground every 10 feet or so to support the lattice work above. Over his head he could see vines intricitely woven through the trellace with oranges the size of cantalope hanging from them. There was a hole where he'd stepped and fallen though. The ground here was a hardpacked dirt and a red moss. Oliver could tell where a rut was from a wheel barrow having been pushed along to gather fruit. Following the rut Oliver started to walk.
The rut led to a small dirt slope and a stone farm house. From the vantage point he stood at Oliver could see that there were small farmhouses like this terraced all along the hillside. He was sure that there would be some kind of a road that he could follow from here to Orless, after all these farms would need to bring their goods to town for markets. It was getting dark and while Oliver was fairly certain that he was safe he still felt it would be better if he found a place to spend the night. Before approaching the farmhouse he took off his back-pack, packed away the Illusive cloak and pocketed the 3 vials of clear potion. Valeria had said that if he took one he'd cease to exist in this world, that could come in handy in a pinch. Summoning up his courage Oliver approached the backdoor of the farm house and knocked. Almost immediately a man answered the door and asked "Oliver of Andmore?" "Yes." Oliver replied not sure who the man was or why he knew his name. "Lucas let us know you'd be coming here, although you were expected several days ago." Oliver thought about Valeria commenting on Lucas' attempts to get Sorcerers out of Orless, his network it turned out wasn't entirely useless afterall.
The farmer gave his name as Carlos and confirmed what Oliver had suspected. His farm had served as the begining of the secret path Lucas had devised to get sorcerers out of Orless and bring them to Andmore. Although only Lucas had ever traveled it. It had been many years since Carlos and Lucas had spoken when a message arrived by carrier bird that had told him of a traveler coming the other way along the path. "I'll take you to the city tomorrow morning by cart." Carlos told him "it's market day and no-one will look twice at the two of use traveling there. Should I ask what you're planning on doing?" "I need to talk to the guild" Oliver told him. "Hmm, best make sure you leave anything behind that you don't want them to take then. The guild will see you but they're paranoid, they'll search you first and take anything they want for good measure." Carlos prepared a little supper for Oliver, a vegetable stew, and showed him to a spare room with a bed. Oliver dumped the contents of his pack out on the bed and emptied his pockets. He placed back into the bag his Illusive cloak, 1 vial of the clear world travelling potion. Looking through the journal he found a loose map that Lucas had tucked in that showed the area around Orless and it's streets, this he put in the backpack. One other vial, and the diary he placed in a rough burlap sack that Carlos had given him. The pirate's food he tossed out the window, dried it could have lasted for years, but soaked wet from the stream in the forest it had already started to rot. Then sitting on the bed he looked at the last remaining vial. Knowing this may be his last change to take the poition like this he unstoppered it, drank it and felt himself fall back into the bed.
Oliver awoke to his mom shouting his name "Oliver! TIME TO WAKE UP!" he climbed out of bed and went downstairs. There his mom was clearly on the way out the door with Grace. "There's cereal in the cupboard you can get it yourself or waffles in the freezer" she said, then stepping out of the door she turned and said "and check your email, I forwarded you something from my cousin about those Andmore stories you were asking about last night." With that she blew him a kiss and left.

#Chapter 12. James the Pirate King
Oliver didn't bother to eat breakfast and instead went straight to the computer in the basement, booted it up and logged into his email. There was an email from his mom, Fwd: Re: James the Pirate King of Alland. Last night his mom had asked her "cousin" really her great uncle Gregory Diamandis's grandson, to send over anything about the Pirate King stories, or other Island of Alland stories. There was a single attachement, a word document that Oliver opened. document was titled "James the Pirate King" the first paragraph was written in Italics.

```
I remember my dad telling me these stories as a child, and then telling them to my children when they were borth. With his passing I want to record them so that I can someday tell them to my grandchildren and so my children can tell them to their grandchildren and so on, continuing this legacy. Most of this is transcribed from my dad's old leatherbound notebooks, where things where faded or illegable I've done my best to fill in what was missing. Robert Diamandis.
```

The story told of the rise, and exploits of James the pirate king. Remembering what Nicolas had told him that the previous pirate king was Gregory Diamandis himself Oliver had the feeling that these stories were probably more auto-biographical than fantasy. In particular Oliver enjoyed the part about how James or Gregory, had found a way out of the bay. At the foot of the mountain where it touched the water there were caves, one such cave, small and only open a few feet at low tide opened into a large grotto and a long winding path that emerged on the other side of the island. James had first done the journey in a small raft but upon raising to the status of Pirate King had custom fit a boat to be able to make the journey.
The stories didn't have a single overaching narrative rather it was a collection of stories meant to be told at bed time in any order the children demanded them. Nearing the end though James started to have more run ins with the Merfolk, his ship was specailly fitted to be able to sail underwater, something Oliver remembered Nicolas saying they'd given up long before. There was no thrilling conclusion, and much to Oliver's dismay there was no story about how James journey to this world.
Finishing the stories Oliver looked at the clock and realized that it was past 1pm, he'd completely forgotten about breakfast and lunch and become so engrossed in the tales of his great grand uncles adventures on the high seas. After quickly making a sandwich Oliver tried to find more mention of Andmore or Orless, or the island of Alland on the internet. There was nothing, trying a different approach Oliver found the website for the Whilmill estate. The site was fairly primitive, giving the address and hours, as well as much of the same information that was in the brocures. There was one interesting thing of note, though, a call out that after his death the books and documents in Gregorys estate had been transfered to the town library part to form the Diamandis collection. The library's website was even more useless it mentioned that the collection existed but nothing else. Realizing he wasn't going to get anywhere from his basement Oliver shut down his computer, grabbed his bike and headed over to the library.
The Diamandis collection was relegated to a back corner of the 2nd floor. It consisted of 1000 books, donated by Robert Diamandis after his father's death. Many of the books where first editions of various works for fiction and non-fiction that Gregory had purchased when he had first arrived. But about 50 books were old leatherbound notebooks that Gregory had hand written. These were the books that Oliver was interested in. Amongst the volumes he found various accounts of the building of the castle, and a diary Gregory had kept as he dated his future wife. At last, he found the book that Robert had mentioned in his transcription. James the Pirate King, like the note had said many pages were faded and smudged. Oliver imagined Gregory writing this as he told his son the stories at bedtime and having worn the book out as he read it over and over again. However missing from the transcription was a beautiful map of the island of Alland. Oliver assumed it was Gregory who had illustrated it. The map resembled the one that had been hung on wall of the peone room but noted on the map were all the locations of James various exploits. Oliver carefully took the book back to the librarian and asked her if he could make a photocopy of the page. The Librarian was happy to oblige. Returning to the collection Oliver replaced the story of the Pirate King and kept searching through the collection. Alas there was no further mention of Andmore, Orless, or the island of Alland. It seemed as though to his mother, her aunt, and uncles, and to her cousins these places where just fantasy that lived in the stories that Gregory told them so they'd fall asleep at night. Leaving the library Oliver returned home shortly after his mother.
"Where where you?" his mom asked. "Library!" Oliver responded. "Find anything interesting?" Oliver hesitated for a minute and then told his mom "I found the original copy of your great uncles story, the one you sent me, and there was this cool map in it." "I thought you'd like those stories," his mom said "Grandpa Gregory always used to read them to read them to me, but I never liked all the pirate stuff, I wanted there to be a princess. He would say to me, 'The princess of Andmore was a fine lady, well read, and very proper, she would not go on adventures, and certainly not with a pirate.' I always thought that was funny... It's odd the things we remember". After dinner Oliver traced the photo copy of the map into his school notebook and tried to draw out his path so far and thought about where he would go next. He knew that tonight he'd go to sleep here and wake up in a comfortable bed in Carlos' farmhouse. He'd travel into Orless and meet the sorcerers guild and then what? In James the Pirate King sorcerers were never very important characters, they often just stayed in their guild hall with their books. In those stories it was the pirates out changing the world, but then again it was a story written by the king of the pirates himself. He thought about the stories he'd heard from Nicolas and read from his great grand uncle and what Valeria had told him. The sorcerers of Orless were powerful but without the Merstone there was little they would be able to do to help him, it seemed that whatever stops he made along the way he would need to find his way to the Southern Sea and the kingdom of the Merfolk. The fact that they were willing to burn Andmore to get to him made him more than a little nervous. As he started to fall asleep he remembered the dream he had about shadows consuming everything but before he could think of it any further he fell fast asleep.

#Chapter 13. The Guild
Oliver woke up to the sound of birds calling and the smell of oranges. Climbing out of bed Oliver felt more well rested then he had for a long time, especially after the last few nights in the shadow lands. Carlos had prepared some oranges and nuts for them to eat before the long ride into the city. Outside a cart was piled high with boxes of oranges and a donkey was hitched waiting impatiently for the two of them to climb on. "Bit of a late start" Carlos noted, "but I didn't want to disturb you after the ordeal I'm sure you've had, and besides we'll still get to the Market early enough." The ride down the hill took about an hour and along the way he pointed out the various farms that dotted this side of the mountain, grapes, stone fruit, lemons, strawberries. This fruit was the economic engine of Orless, but not for it's fresh delicious taste but for what Carlos told him would happen when they got to the city. Market tax, about 10% of the fruit he was carrying would be taken by the Baron of the Stamps. The same would happen to all these other farms. This fruit would be collected and fermented into the various liquors that Orless was famous for. Sweet Orless Gold was what it was called in the Pirate stories he'd read back in his world. There was only one distillery in Orless, operated under the controll of the Baron of the Still and it's immense profits allowd Orless to live fat and happy.
The arrived at the merchants gate of Orless and met with the market traffic. As they entered gurads and men wearing blue tunics inspected their cart. The boxes of oranges were counted, and of the 150 boxes 15 were taken off as tax, the remining boxes were stamped for sale. The whole process was remarkably efficient and only took about 5 minutes. Entering through the gate the cart crossed a cobblestone street and went over a narrow bridge that crossed a cannal. "The merchants canal" Fredick said pointing. "There are 3 cannals that run through the city. This one is for moving goods in and out of storehouses that are built into the cliffs" Oliver looked along the rising cliffs that cut away from the bay to their left. Here the cliffs were almost stright up, along their front building facades with large doors had been built. Oliver imagined all manner of goods that lived behind those doors. Along the cannal flat boats loaded with boxes and casks floated with polemen at the back pushing them into the city or out to see. Looking out into the bay Oliver saw hundreds of ships moored at various posts that emerged from the water. This he remembered from the pirate tales was the port of Orless. The canal barges would move goods in and out of the city to boats waiting in the harbor. The cart turned up the next cobblestone street that ran along a larger cannal again filled with barges and now smaller boats carrying people "The Grand cannal" Carlos called it. Up ahead of them a large domed building stood dominating the landscape. In front of it a large square was bordered by shopes on 2 sides and the end of the Grand canal opposite the domed building. Here in the square the market was in full swing. Stopping their cart Carlos climbed out and yelled "Oranges! Fresh Oranges!" Other vendors were arriving and doing the same.
Oliver had been to a farmers market with his Mom before, and when Carlos had said market that's what he'd expected. What happened instead was something very odd a number of men wearing fine clothes approached Carlos and asked to inspect the oranges, Carlos grabbed a box and let them look at and handle the fruit before returning it. There was some mumbled back and forth and at last 2 of the men haded Carlos slips of paper. After that the farmer sat back on his waggon and relaxed. "Who were they?" Oliver asked. "Buyers," Carlos responded, "they represent the merchants who store and ship things in and out of the city. We talked price and I came to an agreement with 2 of them. 60 cases each" Oliver did the math in his head. They'd left the farm with 150 cases of oranges, 15 were taxed and now another 120 cases were sold. They'd been in the city less than an hour and were already down to 15 cases. Over the next 30 minutes or so verious people wearing nice but simple clothing came by and after a bit of hagling handed over silver coins in exchange for a box of oranges. "Kitchen staff mostly" Carlos explained. "If they can get the time to come to the market they can save money buying directly from me." After a little bit Carlos declared that it was time to head out. Urging the donkey along he manuvered the wagon through the square down to the canal. There he found a mid size barge waiting. He handed over the slips of paper, the bargeman read them shook his head yes and gestured to another man who was wearing a blue tunic. Carlos started to hand him box after box of Oranges until the cart was emptied. The blue tuniced man took a quick count of the boxes, read the slips of paper the barge man had handed him and then wrote a third slip of paper and stamped iit, handing it to Carlos. Carlos thanked the barge man kindly and gave him some of the silver coins from his purse and watched as the barge was pushed off and joined to flow of traffic in the Grand Canal. "What is the paper for?" Oliver asked. "Notice of payment" Carlos said, "That man workes for the Baron of the Bank and this," he held up the stamped slip of paper "says that I'm to be paid money from certain merchant accounts." "So now you go get your money?" Oliver asked, "No, now I go by cloth". Oliver was confused, "cloth?" "Yes I need some to mend clothes and the best place to buy it is the weaver over there" Carlos said pointing. "You want to head that way", Carlos pointed in the opposite direction away from where they'd entered the city, "The guild hall is one street over on the gentlemans cannal you'll find it quite easily, or you could hire a ferryman to take you I suppose, they take Andmorean silver just as readily as Orlessen one since they do enough trade with the harbour.", Oliver realized for the first time since arriving in this world that he didn't have any silver, Andmorean or Orlessen. He didn't want to ask Carlos for money and thought that walking to the guild hall would be better anyway. Waving goodbye he set off.
Off of the main square Oliver found a side street between 2 shops, from their signs a butcher and a tailor. The street cut through to another large cobblestoned road and another smaller canal - Fredick had called it the gentlemans canal. Across the water the land sloped up less sharply than on the other side of the city, here large manner houses were built staggered and terraced along the hillside. This must be where the wealthy of Orless lived. The buildings on this side of the street seemed to be a mix of houses and buisinesses. The businesses seemed to mostly be resturants and cafes. Looking to his right to the end of the canal Oliver saw a series of windowless stone buildings that looked very out-of-place, like little mini temples. Carlos had said that he wouldn't have a hard time finding the guild hall and these buildings must have been what he meant. Remembering he had packed a map of the city that Lucas had given him Oliver pulled it out of his bag and unfolded it. It look him a moment to get his bearing. He saw the layout of the 3 canals - Gentlemans, where he was, Grand, and Merchants. Each canal had a wide street running along each side. Small streets cut between the canals with a large thoughout fare running along the harbour side. The domed building that had overlooked the main square was clearly labeled as Grand Palace and the square in front of it Market Square. Along the Gentlemans canal Oliver found tucked as far from the harbour as anything could be in Orless a building labeled "Sorcerers Guild" To either side were the "Bankers guild" and the "Merchants guild". Oliver turned right and walked to the end of the canal where the large stone buildings stood, above the door to each were guilted carvings, a set of scales, a flask, and a ship. Oliver went to the middle building with the flask carving, climbed the shallow stairs and knocked on the door.
An old man with long flowing blue robes opened the door and gestured Oliver in. The room beyond was dimly lit with soft blue light and quite cramped given the grandure outside. "What is your business with the sorcerers guild?" The man asked. "I traveled here from another world where I was enchanted by a merstone, and now the merfolk are after me!" Oliver answered a little too quickly. The old man seemed skeptical. "Lucas Álvarez sent me from Andmore to you and I had to travel through the Shadow Lands and Valeria saved me, but I think she died." he hadn't meant to tell a whole story just yet but once he started talking Oliver just kept going. A door that had been carefully concealed within the styling of the wall opened and another old man in blue robes stepped out and said "Come this way", the man who had let him into the guild just noded at Oliver as though he should follow the instructions. Oliver walked through the secret door and found himself in a more spacious room resembling a bit a court room. Several men in the same blue robes sat at a high table along one side and Oliver faced them. "For what purpose have the traitors Lucas and Valeria sent you to us?" one of the men asked. Oliver tried to explain, "In my world I found a merstone and touched it then woke up in Andmore, the merfolk attacked so Lucas sent me here to see if you could break the enchantment." "You spoke of our sister Valeria?" one of the other men asked him. "She was in the shadow lands, I rescued her but in the end shadow cats were going to kill us and she stayed behind so I could get here." remembering the explosion Oliver added, "I think she died saving me." The men at the table confired and talked amongst each other. One of them got up and left via another hidden door in the back of the room. Finally the first man spoke again "The news you have brought us is valuable but most unwelcome. We are aware of-course of the Merfolk's attack and the disturbance of power in the shadow lands, but the cause of these things, and the release of our sister Valeria's hold on the Shadow's ambition is grave news for this world. For your help we will gladly disenchant the merstone if you would kindly present it to us." Oliver was confused, the way the man had spoken it seemed they were more upset that he'd freed Valeria than than she'd been killed. He supposed that she was considered a traitor but that didn't seem to be the full extent of the issue. "The merstone please!" the man insisted, "I don't have it." Oliver answered sheepishly, "You didn't bring it with you?" the man asked. "No it stays in my world when I travel here." The sorcerers again confered amongst themselves, Oliver couldn't make out what they were talking about except for one of them saying "No No No" over and over again. Finally they turned to Oliver and gestured to the man who had led him into the room. "This boy" they said addressing the sorcerer who now stood next to Oliver, "is to be escorted out of the guild hall and booked on passage to the next ship to Andmore. He is free to do as he wishes until that ship departs but if he is seen within the city walls after dark he shall be arrested and summarly executed." "What!" Oliver yelled, "You said you'd help me!?" "We cannot help you without the Merstone" one of the Sorcerers said, another one chimed in "You said yourself the Merfolk were after you, if they learn you're here they'll attack Orless just as they attacked Andmore." "And we are helping you," another sorcerer chimed in "you appeared in this world in Andmore for a reason, Lucas is the sorcerer there so it is his duty to get to the bottom of this, if you wish to find a way to break this enchantment it's in Andmore." this last one felt like a bit of a cop out. Oliver could tell there was a certain displeasure with Lucas amongst these men and dropping Oliver back on Lucass lap was a nice way to rid themselves of a problem and stick one to him at the same time.
Oliver was marched out of the Guild hall and down to the end of the canal. There a bell was rung and within a few minutes a ferryman arrived in small boat. Oliver was loaded on board, the ferry man was given instructions, money, and a slip of paper and they were off. As they started to float towards the harbor the ferry man spoke up "Ran afould of the scorcerers ey?", "Kinda" Oliver answered. The Ferryman paused his poling and let the boat drift for a bit, "I don't know what you did, but in my book anyone who upsets them is a good person.", "You don't like the sorcerers?" Oliver asked, "Now, I didn't say that did I," The ferryman seemed taken aback, "but as I see it they spend their time tinkering in their guild hall and eating fine food and drinking fine wine while the rest of us are out here busting our asses for a living.", "Can't they do enchantments to help people?" Oliver asked, "Ha, I've never seen'em do an enchantment at all. Maybe they do, maybe they're helping out that council of Barons and all that, but for us normal people they don't have the time of day" Oliver was fascinated, he thought about what he'd seen Lucas do, and now that he thought of it no one in Andmore even seemed to know who he was. Afterall the kitchen staff at the castle had sent him to the city looking for Lucas when he'd been back at the castle the whole time. "Listen," the ferryman said, "There's lot of boats out in this harbour that are going to Andmore, and this writ I got from the Socerers they don't much care where I put you so as I see it. I could put you on a nice luxary boat and you could live well on your trip, or I could put you on a, let's say, less reputable boat where you could get into a bit of mischeif. Maybe even slip off before it leaves the harbour and find a way to get what you wanted from those old frauds by some other means." Oliver thought about this for a minute and asked "Do you mean to say there's other ways into the guild hall?", "I don't mean to say anything I didn't say" The ferryman quiped, "Just want to know what type of boat you want to be on.", Oliver thought about this and decided "A less reputable one please". "Alright, I understand, slik sheets are soft but don't keep you warm at night!" The ferryman said winking. By now they had reached the entrance to the harbour and he gave the boat a big push guiding it between the two nearest clusteres of boats that were moored and out towards a further mooring where a small single masted vessel was tied up.

#Chapter 14. The Harbour
The Ferry had dropped Oliver off at a boat named "The Silver Eel" it was small by most standards. There had been some hushed conversation between the ferryman and the deck hand who had helped Oliver aboard, then the paper from the guild had been handed over and the ferryman was on his way. Oliver stood on the deck of the boat not sure what to do but watching the chaotic harbour of Orless. Everywhere barges polled their way between the shore and the boats loading and unloading. Between the entrance to the merchant's canal and the grand canal stood a small stone building with a wooden dock, the barges coming back from ships would stop by there and customs officials would come out to inspect the boats before sending them on their way. Other barges moved between large squat boats that sat low in the water and smaller boats that looked built for speed moving goods back and forth. "Beautiful isn't it?" the voice came from behind Oliver and he turned to see a older man in nice but not fine clothing standing on the deck with him. "Who are you?" Oliver asked. "Depends whose asking" was the man's reply. "I'm Oliver... Diamandis" it wasn't really Oliver last name but it was easy for him to remember and maybe it carried some weight here, "Well Oliver, Diamandis was it? I'm Lysander Bouras the captain of this ship and your humble host." the man said the end with a flouish and bow. raising up he looked out at the harbour and as Oliver turned and looked at the large boats that the barges were ferrying goods back-and-forth from Lysander turned and matched his gaze, "wharehouse boats" he said, "you see all the goods that come and go from Orless are subject to a tax. So merchants use those bit warehouse boats to store goods out here and avoid paying the taxes." "Is that legal?" Oliver asked, "Well you see I'm sure the Baron of the Stamps would like his cut, but out here the Baron of the harbour is in change, and so he turns a blind eye to all of this and just collects his large mooring fees." "Who are all these Baron's people keep talking about?" Oliver asked, Fredick had mentioned the Baron of the stamps before but Oliver wasn't sure what it all meant. "You haven't heard of the council of Barons! Where did you say you were from anyway?" "Andmore" Oliver responded quickly, but I'm a farmer we don't learn much about Orless out on the farms. Lysander mulled this over in his head for a moment and then with a smile launched into an explaination.
"The council of Barons rules over Orless and controlls the money and the trade. The members of the counil each rule a different part of the city life. Baron of the bank controlls the cities coffers and insures the money the merchants have. The Baron of the Stamps, assesses and collects taxes for goods brought into the city. The Baron of the Harbour ensures that boats can come and go safely and collects mooring payments. The Baron of the cellar is responsible for making Orlessen wine. The Baron of the watch is responsible for the city guard. Finally the Baron of records is responsible for all the records the city keeps of birth, death, and business. Now the Baron's are elected by the gentleman's council and serve for their life, however it's been so long since a Baron died in service, they more often just resign when they've gotten rich enough and in so doing get to pick their successor. There's always petty squables amongst the Barons but as long as the Baron of the cellar is happy the city is happy". "Petty squables?" Oliver asked, "Yeah, take for isntance those guards with the Baron of stamps men at the customs house." Lysander said pointing to the shore. "Those men work for the Baron of the watch, and they've been known to take a bribe or skim a little off the top, so one time the Baron of Stamps decided he was going to have his own guards. Well Baron of the watch was most displeased and his men started rounding up the Baron of stamp's men for various petty offenses. It eventually got to be so bad that brawls would break out in the street. The Lord Chancelor had to step in on that one." "Lord Chancelor, is he like the king?" Oliver asked, maybe he could plead his case to him? "Well, he's not supposed to be is he," Lysander said slyly, "The Lord Chancelor is ellected by the Gentlemans council and conducts the business of the council. He's not supposed to have any power but anyone whose ever been elected as Lord Chancelor has their fingers in everything, and everyone owes them one." Looking out that the harbour and the city beyond Oliver imagined the web of people, and goods, and influence that flowed everywhere. Coming from the merchant's canal he saw a large barge with two ferrymen poling it, loaded on the barge were large casks carrying a large intriquite brand. Orlessen wine, the center of the web.
"So what exactly is this skullduggery you plan to get into?" Lysander asked Oliver point blank, "I need to get into the guild hall." "Hmm... well that's a question of which guild hall... let's see you don't seem crazy enough to get into the merchants hall, and you don't look foolish enough to get into the bankers hall so I guess you're stupid enough to want to get into the sorcerers hall?" "That's right" Oliver said ignoring how Lysander clearly thought of this idea. "I assume you'll be wanting access to their library?" Oliver hadn't thought about this, he wasn't sure what exactly he'd find in the guild hall but they'd said themselves that they could disenchant a merstone if they had it. IF they had a book telling you how he could try it when he got home. Oliver nodded to Lysander. "Well lucky for you I know just the guy, unforturnately for you he's not cheap, but should we put it on your tab? Lysander produced the paper that the socerer had given the ferry man and wagged it in the air. Oliver nodded again.
That night a small ferry pulled up alongside the cutlass and Lysander whispered to the man poling it along, turning to Oliver Lysander asked "Can you swim?", Oliver wasn't sure about this but answered honestly "Yes". Pleased Lysander loaded Oliver into the ferry and pushed them off. The boat glided quietly into the Gentleman's canal and came to a stop near along the side of the canal where the large mannor houses stood. The ferryman looked at Oliver and said clearly "Just beneath the surface here is a tunnel you take that to the end and you'll come up in a cellar where there will be a woman named Mary, you tell her 'Kate told you to get some books from the cellar' and she'll send you on your way." With that the ferryman used his pole to push the ferry about a half a foot off the canal wall and pointed with one hand to the water. Oliver dove in. The water was cold but not unbearably so although he knew his clothes and belongings would all be soaked from the swim. He groped around in the dark water and found the opening and then holding is breath started to swim along the tunnel. He wasn't sure how long the tunnel was but after a few seconds he started to get claustephobic and worry about being able to breath, trying to surface he felt the hard ceiling of the tunnel above, there was no space to surface. He pulled forward swiming as hard as he could but realizing that this must all have been a scam. He would die here and Lysander and this ferryman would collect his fare from the guild and... and... just then the space above his head opened up and he quickly kicked up and popped out in a small well. He was able to pull himself out and dropped onto the floor of a stone cellar. From the distance he heard footsteps, standing and trying to act natural Oliver realizd that being dripping wet it was going to be obvious what had happened, so he looked for a palce to hide. Before he could move though a woman holding a small torch entered the room. "Are you Mary?" Oliver asked, "I am, and what are you doing here?" the woman responded. "Kate told me to go get some books from the cellar" Oliver said. The woman smiled and said "Right this way". She led the way to a back corner of the celler and then slid a shelf out of the way to reveal a series of staris going down into the water. "Tut tut, water level is quite high tonight, still it's managable, second door to your left" with that she lit a tourch that was hanging on the wall indies the room, handed it to Oliver and shooed him along.
The passage beneath was cramped and the water went up to Oliver's armpits but he was able to hold the torch above the water and walk. He passed a ladder on his left and then stopped at a second one the latter went up to a trap door. Standing on the latter and reaching up he pushed the trap door open. He climbed up and foundhimself in a small room. a closet of sorts filled with broken bits of various things. Feelign the clausterphobia setting in again he pushed open the closet door and stepped into a large wooden room. From the books on the wall this Oliver surmised was the Library.

#Chapter 15. The Library
There were thousands of books along the walls and Oliver didn't know where to start. walking along and looking at the book shelves he noticed labels with numbers but the books weren't labeled on the spine like books in his world were are and even then he couldn't read every spine of every book in this library. Dismayed he turned to the middle of the room. There on a table lay 2 books one smaller closed and off to the side the other larger one left open. Dishevled papers were strewn on the table with a large ink blot where an inkwell had spilled. It looked to Oliver as though someone had been working here when they were called away suddenly. Glancing at the open book Oliver started to read the handwritten page that was open. The writing was hard to parse and harder still to read but it seemed to be dealing with traveling between world. The Author suggested that there may be places where the barrier between worlds was thin and with a skilled enchantment someone could pass through. Opening the small book Oliver found the first page with a large block letter inscription Merfolk Artifacts. He flipped through the pages and found it refreshingly familar, like Grego's journal, the pages contained illustrations and various notes about the each artifact. He found a sketch of what looked like a Merstone and read.

```
Mersone
These are grown in the sea forge deep beneath the ocean the ocean by the Merfolks Artificers. A merstone will bond with it's owner and confer on them a permanent enchantment so long as the merstone remains in their possesion. The strength and logevity of these enchantments speak to the process by which the merstones are made, as even the least skilled apprentence is able to craft one that far outlasts anything of even the best human craft. When carefully cleared of the enchantment the merstone may act as a resonator bonding with a sorcer and giving them the ability to enhace their powers. The process of clearing the merstone's enchantments is a carefully guarded secret of the sorcerers guild.
```

Just then Oliver heard footsteps approaching, hurridly he grabbed the small book and retreated to the closet. Just as he shut the door behind him he heard voices talking as the entered the room. He could recognize one of the speakers from the group of sorcerers who had expelled him earlier. "What are we going to?" the man asked. His compainion spoke in a softer more shakey voice as though he was older "We will do what we've always done, prepare for the worst and protect what our order has built". "It's not going to be the way it's always been, don't you understand that?" "Maybe not the way it's always been for you, but remember I've been here longer, we may have to start sending some of our weaker initiates out on expiditions to the Shadow lands but so be it." "I don't think that's going to be enough, Valeria kept the Shadow in check but she also showed it a much bigger world that it could reach, I doubt initaties will sactiate it." "Then we don't send initaties" "What, masters?" "Why not, there are more than a few we could do well to be rid of, and if we're luckly they'll find a way to contain it as Valeria did. Now what of the boy?" Oliver's ears perked up. "The boy - he's Lucas' problem" "No, you fools sent him right into the hands of the Merfolk, do you really think whatever boat he boards is going to make it across the bay?" "Maybe not, but then the Merfolk will have him, so what? they can do what they want with him." "Don't you see how this is all connected, the shadow's growing ambition, the boys arrival and the Merfolk seeking him out, attacking the surface. We must maintain balance." "And if we had kept him here and the merfolk had attacked - we haven't had a shipment in nearly a year, our greenhouse has not produced a viable flower for many years before that, if we're forced to go back to Lucas... well, lets just say that we must to everything in our power to avoid war, even if it means giving this boy over to the merfolk." Just then Oliver heard shouting from outside and then a third voice loudly in the libary "Masters come quick!" "What is it?" the older voice asked, "We're under attack!" the man called. Oliver heard hurried footsteps and then nothing, he peeked out the door and saw that the Library was empty.
Realizing the search would be pointless he turned back to the closet and was just about to climb into the trap door he heard a loud crash. All of a sudden the water in the passage below bubbled up and came flooding over the floor the water was filling in at an alarming rate. Oliver ran out into the library and found a staircase that lead up to the main door, he climbed it and trying the door found it locked. The water had now flooded into the library and started to fill the room. Looking around Oliver tried to find some place higher he could get do. Some of the tallest shelves had ladders that went up to the top. Oliver tucked the book he'd grabbed in his bag, the map he'd been carrying was soaked through and had started to fall apart, he threw it out into the water. As he grabbed it his fingers brushed against a soft fur. The Illusive cloak, Oliver had forgotten he'd packed it, he took the cloak out and draped it over his shoulders.Waded out into the water that was now up to his knees he made a b-line for the ladder. Then thinking about the book he'd seen on the table he turned and made his way over to it. The book was too large to fit into his bag but he tore out the open page and 1 on either side of it and folded them quickly and tucked them away. By now the water was almost up to his waist and he had to hold the bag up over his head to ensure it would stay dry. He raced to the ladder and started to climb. The top of the ladder met a rail at the top of the bookshelf alowing it to slide around other than that the tops of the shelves were non-discript. Oliver tried to slide the ladder but the bottom wheels seemed to be jammed. As he looked down he started to watch as the water flooded higher and higher. Suddenly there was a yelling at the door and it burst off of it's hinges into the room with a shower of red. A young woman in a blue cloak peaked in then yelled "All Clear" behind her and left. With the door gone Oliver had his chance for escape he realized that the water would be too deep and he'd need to swim, the book with the answers he may have been seeking this whole time could be destroyed. Looking around he noticed the door floating in the water jammed on a shelf near the base of the ladder. Of course, he climbed down and then tossed his bag to the floating door. It landed right on the edge with it's strap dipping into the water, but the book was safe. After that he jumped into the water himself and swam to the door, pushing it off the shelf and pushing it back to the steps which were now almost summerged. He quickly climbed out of the water grabbed the bag and threw it over his shoulder and exited out the door.
Oliver stood in a long arcade allway with arches in front of him. Beyond the arches as a large open room that looked the inside of a church. Trying to get his bearing from being underground Oliver thought about all the turns he'd taken to get here and then feeling he had as good a chance at any for being right he went off to his left. The hallway circled around the inner room and off to the side Oliver passed an alcove with stairs going up, another with stairs going down, although here he saw water bubbling up. Then a small door, pushing the door open he recognized the room where he had been interrogated earlier in the day. Oliver ran across the room and through the door to the entrance room and out the door of the guild hall.

#Chapter 16. The Battle of Orless
Outside the level of the water had raised up to wash over the street. boats that had been tied up in the harbour. In the sky above him Oliver watched fireballs rain from the sky. Clearly the Merfolk knew he was here and had decided to attack. As the fireballs fell from the sky the exploded above the city as though met with an invisible shield. The Sorcerers guild must be protecting the city. Oliver knew that if the city kept flooding he'd be swept away, he'd have to make it out of the city and up into the mountains. Near him now he saw the road wind it's way up to the manor homes on the slope, then he thought about that burlap sack with Lucas' journal and his staff and the world traveling potion. Heading out from the guild hall Oliver turned down left and headed towards the water. The flooding had left the streets ankle deep in water so Oliver took it carefully to avoid falling. He had barely made it past the merchant's guild hall when from out of the water a large scaly body emerged. Standing up the creature was nearly twice Oliver's height with long lanky limbs, and sharp taloned hands. It's face was elongated with bulging eyes set too far up to look normal, its lipless mouth showed needle like teeth. The creature held in it's hand what looked like a spear, but rather than the shine of metal it seemed to be fashioned from stone. The creature looked right at Oliver and lowered it's spear so the point was level with Oliver's heart and charged. Suddenly out of nowhere a Shadow Cat lept onto the creature biting it with his sharp teeth, the two fought for a moment but in the end the shadow cat landed a few good blows and the creature sulked back to the water. Turning the shadow cat seemed not to notice Luca but sniffed the air. A flash of yellow light struck the cat and he was thrown into the water with a yelp. From one of the side streets a young woman in a blue cloak came running. Behind her one of the city guard followed. Looking left and right the woman seemed to look right past Oliver until she started along right towards him and then stopped.
"Where did you come from?" she said startled almost on top of Oliver, "Andmore!" Oliver said instictively. "Bad luck for you, Merfolk have left humans alone for hundreds of years and then all of a sudden both cities attacked within a week. Come on we can't stay here!" The woman pushed past Oliver and headed towards the end of the canal. Oliver thought to just continue on his way but decided he was safer to follow this woman so turning he ran to catch up. The trio circled the end of the canal and headed for the manor street. The water had continued to rise and while it was still below his knees Oliver realized that if they didn't make it to high ground soon he'd have to start swimming soon. They followed the street up past many of the houses till the reached a level spot where they could turn and look out on the city. From here Oliver could see the scale of destruction that was being wrought on the city. Above them fireballs still broke harmlessly on whatever enchantment had been put in place, but below water was easily reaching the front door of every building in the city. In the main square the large warehouse barges had come loose and been driven down the grand canal and into the palace. Other smaller boats were smashed or stuck on the various signs and debris that floated throughout the city. When Oliver had left Andmore there was a battle but the city seemed well defended, The destruction was nothing like what had been brought on Orless. Was this all for me? Oliver wondered. "The cellars?" the guard said "Lost" was the one word response from the sorceress. "The merfolk could have come at us from the canals," she added, then continuing "but they brought this tide in order to get to the cellars." "The wine cellars? Why would they want them I thought they were - " Oliver cut himself off before finishing the sentance. "To make it hurt" the sorceress responded, "same thing they did to Andmore when the burned the grain stores." Oliver understood in an instant, all the trade back and forth between Andmore and Orless, the wine and the fruit coming out of Orless made for good pirate tales, but Andmore had farms that could grow grains, grains made bread, and bread made cities work. By going after the grain stores the Merfolk had wiped out Andmore's primary export, now they'd done the same to Orless it would take at least a year before either city recovered.
Oliver stared at the city thinking about why both cities would be made to suffer just for his being there, before he could come up with a good reason though he noticed the bodies emerging from the water near the gentleman's canal. "Look there he pointed" The water level wasn't rising so quickly anymore but had these been men standing tall they would barely have their heads out of the water, as it was the forms that emerged from the water stood such that the water was barely to their chest. "Merfolk" the sorceress said. Oliver counted 12 of them total they scoured the area around the guild halls and then turned to the hill and started to make their way to the road. "Come on" the sorceress lead them further up the road, by now they had almost reached the top of the hill that represented the edge of the city. Here a large estate sat sprawling across a terrace and fields beyond. The sorceress lead them around the house and into a with neatly planted rows of squat trees beyond. They went the length of the garden and then with a flick of her wrist a jet of blue light came from out of the sorceresses cloak, curled around her hand and shot into the ground. Jumping after it the sorceress dissapeared. The city guardsman nervously approached and then quickly dissapeared as well. Oliver approaching saw there was a neat hole in the ground and dropped in to join his traveling companions.
"Where are we?" Oliver asked looking around at the small cave they had dropped into. The walls were smooth as though shaped and there was clearly evidence that someone had lived here, although long ago. "In my misspent youth." The sorceress joked. "This was my get-away, my hideout when I couldn't stand my parents anymore, that house we passed is where I grew up." The city guardsman whistled, "Look I gave up all of that when I joined the guild" she added.

#Chapter 17. Morning
The trio spent the night hidden in the cave not talking much. The sorceresses name was Sofia the guard's name was Matias, Oliver had given his name as James, he wasn't sure if word of his banishment would have spread yet but he thought it was safer to use a fake name. They had all slept a little with Oliver's night being filled with nightmares of the ocean swallowing up his mom and sister. The next morning emerging from the cave they took stock of the city below. The waters had receeded but all the debris from the harbour were still strewn all over the city streets. People were moving about and Oliver could tell that some of them where trying to clean up. Sofia set out at the head of the group and started to head down hill to the city, Matias obediently followed her. Oliver hung back he wasn't sure what his next step was. He could return to the city and then make his way to Carlos' farm where the dairy and staff were. He thought about the Shadow Cat that had been in the city last night and what the Sorcerers where saying about the shadow's growing ambition. Maybe the diary with the guide to the shadow lands would come in handy. Then again Oliver had no intention of returning to the shadow lands, the older sorcerer seemed to think he was important and if he could break the enchatment bringing him to Alland then the Shadow Cats and all of that wouldn't matter. Before he could decide his next step Sofia turned to him seeing him fall behind and said "Come on we should stick together". Oliver hurried to catch up, thinking about how she'd blasted the Shadow Cat last night Oliver felt like sticking with Sofia may be the safest option for now. Reaching the bottom of the hill Sofia lead the group over to the sorcerers guild hall, the door was open. Thinking this may be the perfect time to split up with the group, and avoid getting caught, Oliver waved towards the main square and said "I'm going to head off this way". Sofia gave him a withering look and said "I need some supplies, and we all need to figure out what our next move is. You're both my guests so you'll be fine in here." Feeling powerless with the look she'd given him Oliver followed Sofia and Matias into the guild hall.
They took a different hidden door from the entry room that lead to a flight of stairs and up to the second floor of the guild hall. From there Sofia took them to a large room with all manner of vials and beakers set up. The hall itself seemed just as deserted as it was last night. "Where is everyone?" Matias asked, "Downstairs probably, repairing the damage to the city's protective enchantments" Sofia offered. For his part Oliver just watched her work a bit manic like Lucas but with a lazer like focus. She took off her cloak draping it over a chair. Beneath the cloak she wore a bandolier filled with little vials, some vials were still full, some were partially filled, and others looked empty. She pulled the vials out setting them into a rack at the table and started mixing and working various potions at the small fireboxes that were set around the room. As she worked Matias poked around the lab and seemed lost in his thoughts, "James!" Sofia shouted and it look a second for Oliver to realize that she meant him and come over. In front of her was a beaker of red liquid that simmered over a small fire. "Come here" she said with a gesture. When he got closer all of a sudden a tendril of red light reached out of the beaker, twisted around her hand and then wrapped around his throat, he was pulled closer to her and she whispered. "I know you're that boy who we banished yesterady. The one the Merfolk are after. What I don't understand is why you came back into the city, and why I shouldn't kill you for it?" opting for honesty Oliver responded in a whisper "My name isn't James it's Oliver and I just needed answers" "and your answers are more important than the destruction of my home?" "No, well, if I don't figure out how to break the enchantment that brings me to this world then no one is safe." Oliver hadn't meant to sound so dramatic, but whispering anything while being choked by a magical noose had a tendancy to do that. Sofia relaxed her hand and the red light retreated back into the beaker. "Ok, Oliver, I'll help you to figure out this enchantment." "What about Matias?" Oliver asked, "I said I'll help you figure out this enchantment not how to convince a city guardsman not to kill you." Sofia said smiling her sly smile that always accompanied these sarcastic remarks, turning she went back to her task of refilling the vials.
They were out of the guild hall about half an hour after they'd entered. Oliver still hadn't told Matias anything causing Sofia to cast one of those withering stares at him everytime Matias called him James. Sofia had lead the way out of the hall and annouced her plan, "We should head south, along the shore road and towards the straights.", "You don't think it would be better to help out around the city?" Matias asked "I'm not going to be much help around here, I'm not really one for those big flasy protective enchantments. My thinking is we go to the Merfolk and see if we can figure out why they're attacking, maybe put a stop to it." Matias looked at Oliver apeallingly "James what do you think" those death eyes shot across from Sofia again, trying to seem wise Oliver replied "I can't fight, and I can't enchant things, if I stay here and the Merfolk attack again tonight I'll probably end up getting killed. At least on the road I'll have some say in it." Matias nodded slowly frustrated Sofia cut it "Look you helped me yesterday in the cellar and I helped you but that doesn't mean we need to stick together, you want to stay here and defend the city if an attack comes, stay, me and kid are heading south." with that she started to head down the street to the waterfront. "No I'm coming" said Matias following, Oliver pulled up the rear of the trio.

#Chapter 18. The Costal Road
The coastal road ran from the southern gate of Orless to a small fishing village at the southern most extant of Alland. As they came to the city gate Matias prepared them for the various emergency proceedures that would be invovled and how they could expect to get passed them. Sofia just laughed a little. The gate itself was open with one guard standing in front of a huge crowd of shouting people, Sofia waved to him as they passed and the guard tried to acknoledge her but then a woman started shouting in his face and he turned to deal with her. "Hows that for emergency proceedure?" Sofia asked Matias after they'd gotten out of earshot of the gate. "What were all those people doing?" Oliver asked. "Looking for loved ones who were in the city last night." Matias said horrified, "I guess with all that's going on the guard don't really have time to check everyone who want's to go in or out." "Right" Sofia added, "Emergency plans are all well and good till you have an emergency." The trio walked in silence for a little after that. It was Matias who broke the silence, "So what exactly is the plan?" "Well" Sofia thought for a few seconds then said "This road goes to Rockedge, there's an Inn there to sleep at and food to eat, I say we go there and figure out what our next steps are." "So you don't know?" Matias asked incredioulusly. "Not yet" Sofia gave a hopeful response, "any thoughts" she added turning to Oliver, "I trust you" was all Oliver could add.
They walked for most of the day and with the sun starting to get lower in the sky the passed a covered wagon that was pulled off to the side of the road. "Wait here" Sofia said and walked over to the wagon, found the owner just inside the back and chatted with him for a few moments, returning to the group she gave them the good news. "He'll let us stay with him and he'll feed us, he's ripping it off with the amount of money he wants but it's worth it. Strength in numbers this far from the city." The man's name was Dane and he was a traveling performer. He found he wasn't welcome much of anywhere so he'd tried to find little hamlets and collections of farms where he could stage performances. Most places just paid him in food so he could at least say he was fed. He prepared them a large meal with some sort of poultry, forraged mushrooms, and a sweet golden liquor he called honey wine. Oliver, and Sofia went easy on the Honey wine Matias and Dane did not. The evening quickly turned to song with Dane performing with a large stringed instrument he called a Klavenet. It sounded hauntingly beautiful as he played songs of bravery and adventure. As more honey wine was drunk Matias started to sing raunchier songs of less noble exploits. Sofia laughed and blushed a little. Before long Dane let everyone know that he would be on his way to Orless in the morning. He'd seen the attack and knew that the city needed some cheering up. Sofia asked if he wouldn't prefer to join them in Rockedge but Dane just shook his head and said "Not welcome anymore I'm afraid" with that he loudly annouced he needed to pee and walked off into the bushes. Matias had fallen asleep after what must have been his 10th glass of honey wine and was now snoring loudly by the fire.
"Can I ask you a question?" Oliver said turning to Sofia "You just did!" Sofia joked, ignoring her Oliver said what was on his mind. "You don't seem like the other sorcerers I've met, except, well you said you couldn't help with the enchantments, why is that?" Sofia smiled "I'm doing a bit of indepentent study when it comes to my techniques. If you were to ask my teachers they would say that I'm covering up for my lack of talent, but I'm trying to revive a lost artform that they don't understand." "A lost artform?" "Yeah, combat sorcerry. You see there was a time when sorcerers weren't just cloistered in the guild hall putting protective enchantments on the city, we got out into the thick of things and had adventures, and we could use enchantments like weapons." "Like the way you took out that shadow cat yesteday" "Is that what they're called? I guess yes that's the sort of thing that a combat sorcerer would do." "Wait you've never fought a shadow cat before?" Oliver asked, "I've never seen one before, or Merforlk for that matter, well now that I think about it it was a night of firsts since that was the first time I was actually in a fight and got to use enchantment." "Well I thought you did well" Oliver added, "Thanks, not that it means much coming from you." rolling over by the fire she added, "goodnight Oliver". Oliver closed his eyes and tried to sleep but found he kept laying awake, he tried rolling to one side then the other. In front of him the fire had died down to just embers. He closed his eyes, blinked them open and then suddently stared up. Standing across the fire from him was a tall figure, a Merfolk.
The Merfolk was huge like the one he had seen last night, but rather than the lanky frame and arms this one seemed more soft featured. Like the creature last night his eyes were perched a little too high on his head and buldged a little. When he opened his mouth to speak Oliver expected a booming voice but what came out sounded almost like a hoarse whisper, maybe intended only for him. "Traveler, I come to you with a warning. If you try to reach the Merfolk kingdon in the southern sea you will be captured and your friends will die!" "Please I just want to get back home!" Oliver pleaded in a whisper. "There is a war coming, there are many who would see you a a prize to be won, or a weapon to be weilded, beware them. If you wish to head my advice and avoid disaster you may use this to call me." With that the Merfolk placed a white stone on the ground and, as quickly has he'd shown up, dissapeared into the night. Shaken Oliver turned to wake Sofia giving her a gentle shove, she woke with a start and grabbed Oliver's arm so hard he thought she'd break it. After a second she relaxed and then looking about asked in a quiet voice "What is it?" Mimicing her whisper Oliver told her "There was a merfolk here, he just left." Sofia's faced turned stern, she rose cautiously her head and eyes scanning the darkness as she moved slowly around the fire and surveyed the line of trees that seperated the road from the water. Oliver went to get up but almost as if she could sense his thoughts she gestured back for him to stay. He sank back down to the ground. After a second she returned to the fire "Seems to be gone, but we should set a watch in case they return" Sofia said, with this last suggestion she looked around at their party. Oliver had never felt so small under her gaze but it was an even less withering stare than Matias got loudly snoring off to the side, all of a sudden Sofia asked "Where's Dane?!" Oliver hadn't seen him since, he couldn't really remember after the whole thing with the Merfolk. Sofia turned away again and started to head for the tree line, Oliver rose this time not getting a gesture and followed. There they found Dane passed out leaning on a bush. He had clearly passed out after going pee, Sofia and Oliver dragged Dane back to the fire and left him to sleep out the night. At last looking at the fully assembled group Sofia waved her arms and some blue light formed a small circle around them and then settled to the ground before dissapearing. "Protection ring" she said looking at Oliver. "Should let us all get some sleep tonight, we're going to need the rest for the trip ahead." With that Sofia lay down and almost imediately went to sleep. Oliver lay down but couldn't sleep looking over at where the merfolk had stood he saw on the ground the rock the merfolk had left. It resemebled a Merstone but instead of the jet black color it was pure white. Oliver got up and walked the the stone, staring at it nervously, then picking it up he placed it in his back and lay back down. Oliver stayed there awake most of the night, finally falling to a dreamless sleep for a few hours.

#Chapter 19. Rockedge
As daylight broke Matias and Dane woke up a bit worse for the wear. Dane set about preparing some breakfast for the group. Oliver had resolved the night before to tell Matias the truth about who he was, after all if the Merfolk was right and this was going to end in Matias and Sofia dieing then he felt like they should at least know why. However before he could say anything to Matias Sofia pulled him aside to the tree line. When the two returned Matias looked ashamed, Oliver imagined that Sofia had probably been furious that he'd passed out so drunk that he could have defended them. Deciding that it was best not to tell Matias that not only had he failed last night but this mission was probably also a suicide one Oliver left the man to eat his breakfast in peace.
After eating the trio split ways with Dane and continued down the costal road to Rockedge. "We should be there by sundown." Sofia declared confidently. Most of the way was silent, Matias seemed to be suffering from a mix of the chastizing and the hangover he'd recieved, Sofia on the other hand seemed to have a lazer focus on the road ahead. Oliver didn't feel either of them were particularly approachable. The road itself didn't see many travelers, here and there a side road would lead off to the right, up into the mountains there along the mountain side Oliver could see more farms terraced along. As they had traveled further south the mountain was growing shorter, the houses smaller, and more spread out. They people they did pass seemed mostly to be traveling between the various hamlets along the side of the mountain. Everyone knew of what had happened in Orless, everyone with family who had been there had already reached the southern gate to try to find them. For most of the farmers though the real worry wasn't the people in the city but the markets that it held. While they despised the market tax many of them had fruits growing that they needed to sell, when the markets were growing would mean the difference between making enough money to feed and cloath their families or watching their fruit die on the vine. Their one hope was for those with fruits to trade with farmers who had heartier vegetables that could be stored in a root cellar. By being careful and resourceful they could at least have enough food for until the markets opened again. With each group that passed Sofia gave Oliver a harsh look as if to say "This is your fault". Oliver for his part thought back to what the Merfolk had said the night before, "we have other need of you", what did that mean?
The trio arrived at Rockedge just as twighlight was settling in. The small fishing village was largely comprised of wooden huts built wherever flat and solid ground could be found along the rocky coastline. Almost every house was built beside the water with a small dock and a small boat nearby. Just offshore were larger boats moored to posts as in Orless. The one larger building in town was the local Inn. It served the needs of a town meeting hall, a bar, and a haven for sailors that were stopping over in Orless. This is where Sofia lead them. "We'll be able to get a proper room and a hot meal here." She added. The interior of the Inn was dimly lit by lamps and a large fire place, Sofia quickly spoted the woman working behind a bar that seemed to be in charge and approached her to discuss rooming. After a bit of back-and-forth Sofia produced some sliver coins counted out a stack then split it and gave half to the woman, pocketing the second half. The woman gestrured to an empty table in the corner by the fireplace and Sofia headed for it beconing Matias and Oliver to follow. "She said they were booked full," Sofia said as Matias and Oliver sat at the table, "I told her it was official guild business and suddenly a room opened up at the 'official business rate' which is just robbery if you ask me", Sofia seemed visibly upset about this. Oliver thought back to the large manor house where she had said she'd grown up, his friend Kyle was like this, large house never without everything he'd ever wanted but always a bit upset whenever he felt like something was too expensive.
Dinner was a fish stew, it was indeed a hot meal as Sofia had promised although Oliver didn't much like the taste of it. He ate it knowing that from this point on they probably wouldn't be eating many hot meals. Cups of Orlessen wine were brought to the table, when Matias lifted his cup Sofia shot him a stern look, after that he drank slowly matching her pace and finishing just once cup with dinner. It was starting to grow late and men in various ragged and salt stained clothes had started to wander in and buy drinks at the bar, some seemed like local fisherman who bumped into unexpected friends, others were clearly sailors some regulars, some newcomers but all of them seemed to try to be friendly with the proprietor as she served them cup after cup of wine from behind the bar. "Let's head up to our room, it's going to get a little crazy down here." Sofia said eyeing a group of sailors who had just entered the bar wearing ragged salt stained clothing. Oliver and Matias followed her lead, climbed a set of stairs to a loft over the kitchen where a series of rooms were. One of them stood open with a key in the door. Entering Matias closed the door behind them, taking the key and locking it from the inside. The room was sparesly furnished with 2 small beds and table and a chair. Sofia lit a small lamp that sat on the table, but otherwise the only source of light was from a dirty window that had been left open. Crossing to the window Sofia closed a heavy wooden shutter on the outside and then shut the glass window on the inside making the room even darker. "We'll keep watch in shifts, 3 hours each, and then we get an early start in the morning?" Sofia said, posing it as a question but both Oliver and Matias had the sense that it was intended more as a statement. "What about a protective enchantment?" Oliver asked hoping to not have to keep watch, knowing that he wouldn't be able to do anything if the Merfolk decided to attack. Reaching into her cloak Sofia withdrew a mostly empty vial with just a few drops of blue liquid in it. "I used up most of this yesterday night" she said, again casting a harsh look at Matias. "Can't you make more?" Oliver asked, he realized almost instantly how silly the question was, he'd seen Lucas and Sofia make potions before, while they both had a manic energy to them the process was clearly exacting and there was no way they'd be able to do it in this small room. In a tone that made him feel even stupider Sofia added "The ingredients in these potions aren't just something you find at a local inn. These are some of the rarest plants and flowers in the world, cultivated specifically in the gardens at the guild hall. I won't be able to make more of anything until we return there." the statement left a tension hanging in the air, it was broken by Matias who eager to redeem himself piped up "I'll take the first watch". Nodding Sofia moved to one of the beds sitting down and removing her boots she said "Wake me for second watch", then laying down and closing her eyes and seemed to almost instantly fall asleep. Oliver marveled at how she'd done something similar the night before. She'd said she was training for combat sorcerery, he wondered if this ability to fall asleep quickly and sleep lightly was part of that. Not feeling exceptionally tired but knowing that he'd be woken up in 6 hours anyway Oliver laid down and tried to sleep. It took nearly an hour for him to finally sleep all the while he could hear Matias pacing and muttering to himself.
Oliver saw his mother and his sister, playing by the beach. All of a sudden a huge tidal wave came rushing towards the shore, there was screaming, and he yelled at them "Run! Run!" they seemed frozen in place, running to them to try to grab them they wouldn't move. Turning to the shore he saw decending from a mountain a dark shadowy cloud that left everything in it's path shrouded in darkness... "Oliver" the voice was Sofia's and she was shaking him awake. "It's your watch", Oliver opened his eyes, and sat up wearily. The lamp had been extinguished and the room was pitch black, straining he could just barely make out Sofia's shape standing beside the bed. Getting up Oliver saw Sofia take his place in the bed he fumbled his way to where he remembered the chair and table had been. Bumping into them he nearly yelled out but caught his tongue not wanting to wake anyone, settled down to the chair and started to take stock of his situation. From Rockedge he knew there would be no more roads. The landscape here was already that of a fractured rocky coast but further south he remembered the maps he'd seen depected a broken string of islands. He wasn't sure how far they had to go but even if they were close it would likely be slow going and it could be days before they reached the straights. They'd need to take food and water which would slow them down further, they'd also be exposed to merfolk attack. Of course when they actually made it to the straights then they'd have to find a way to get to the Merfolk kingdom under the southern sea and find a way to break the enchantment of a merstone that didn't even exist in this world. The whole quest seemed rather hopeless. Oliver just hoped that Sofia had a plan that she hadn't shared with them.
Oliver found various ways to while away the time, huming songs to himself and playing little games in his head until some light started to peak through the shutters over the window. He wasn't sure how long it had been but it had felt like an eternity so he decided it was as good a time as any to wake people. Crossing to the window he opened the glass and then pushed open the shutters to allow in the beginings of daylight, outside he could see the harbour, shrouded in a thick fog. Turning he saw that Sofia had already awoken he gave Matias a rough shake and got a slap from one hand. Shaking again Matias rolled and groggily opened his eyes. "James?" he said, this reminded Oliver again that he needed to come clean with Matias about his identity and resolved to do so today. With the whole group up they proceeded downstairs, leaving the key behind in the lock where they'd left it. The inn keeper had prepared a breakfast for them, a thick porrage that tasted terrible but was warm and filling. In addition there was a stack of dried fruits and meats that they could take with them on their journey beyond. Sofia and Matias packed some of these into their bags, Oliver did the same and as it did he took stock of the contents of the bag itself. The book on mermaid artifacts, the pages ripped from the book traveling between worlds, and 1 vial of the potion Lucas had given him. Thinking about Sofia's nearly empty vial of potion from the night before he remembered the extra vial, the staff, and Lucass notebook that he'd left with Carlos north of Orless. He'd thought that it would be best to keep them safe while he met with the guild, not thinking that his adventures would lead him in the opposite direction, come to think of it, Oliver hadn't given much thought to leaving anything behind since he hadn't planned on having any more adventures after meeting with the guild.
With their bags packed and their stomaches full they headed out of the inn and turned south away from the costal road, crossing in front of the inn by the water. As they did Oliver noticed a small boat tied off to a rock at the shor and just out at sea a wide squat boat was moored. Suddenly from behind them a voice boomed "Oliver!" Oliver and Sofia turned and there coming from near the inn was a man dressed in clothes had had clearly once been fine, but now showed the wear of many storms.

#Chapter 20. Shadow Run
"Oliver, I thought it was you!" Nicolas said, leading a group of his men towards the shore. "You know this pirate?" Sofia asked Oliver, before he could respond Nicolas jumped in "Know me, he's been very profitable to me indeed! First he saved my men and I from that sorceress in the Shadow lands, and now I find out he's gone and wiped out all the gain stores in Andmore and all the wine stores in Orless making my own horde worth that much more." with that he gave a laugh. Sofia seemed livid "You mean all the wine you stole?" she said clenching a fist. "Easy sorceress, Nicolas added, I'm a pirate I'll pay my due in my own time." Oliver turned to Matias, he looked confused not sure what to make of this exchange. Thinking about what Nicolas had said about pirates being hospitable as long as you were profitable he turned back to the pirate king and said, "seeing how profitable I've been to you I need you to do us a small favor." "You ask the favor I'll decide the size." Nicolas replied, "Take us to the Merfolk's kingdom in the southern sea." Oliver asked. He knew that Nicolas was afraid of the Merfolk, but perhaps Sofia's wrath would inspire the pirate king to flaut his skills. "Ha! You're not that profitable!", Nicolas said with a laugh. I could take you to the straights but to go any further is death, and my route out of the bay was closed up behind me when I came back, probably thanks to you." "You mean the tunnel that Pirate King Gregory Diamandis used?" Oliver said remembering the stories. Nicolas's face lit up, "I've changed my mind" he said, "this is no small favor you ask me, but come with me to Shadow run and if you can make me a little more profitable I'll do this thing for you." Oliver nodded and Nicolas lead the way to the launch that was tied up by the shore. Turning to Matias Oliver quickly said "I'll explain everything, I promise, just come with us" but before he could get a response Sofia grabbed Oliver and turned him around to face her. "He's a pirate" she said, "he can't be trusted, if we go over to his boat he's just as likely to kill us as help us." "I trust him" Oliver said, "he's saved my life before, and like he said I've done a lot to help him, he owes me one." Sofia furrowed her brow at Oliver so he decided there was only one thing to say, the thing that had been knawing at him all night, "He'll take us to the southern kingdom, do you have a plan to do that?" Sofia's gaze lowered and she seemed a bit resigned by the comment finally saying, "alright let's go".
By the time they'd reached the shoreline the launch had already left with some of the men. Nicolas and a few of the others were waiting on the shore for it's return. "Good to see you're joining us" Nicolas said gesturing to Sofia in particular. Sofia for her part looked put off by the gesture but nodded in response. With nothing to do but wait for the launch to return Matias turned to Oliver deciding now was the time to have his questions answered, "Oliver is it, not James? Please tell me what this pirate is talking about blaming you for the Merfolk attack on Orless?!" the way he accentuated Merfolk attack hinted at a real anger behind the question. Oliver tried to think of the simipilest explaination but struggled to come up with the words. "Look in my world I touched a merstone, and then I woke up here" he said before continuing to ramble through the story "Lucas sent me back but then I came back here and then ther Merfolk were attacking Andmore so I was supposed to go through the Shadow lands to Orless and then the guild couldn't help me so I was supposed to go back to Andmore but then the Merfolk attacked Orless, and that's when I met you." Matias didn't seem impressed by the explaination. "He's the one who was banished from the city Sofia cut in helpfully" Matiass eyes narrowed in rage, "You're the one the Merfolk were after when they attacked Orless?" he said accusing Oliver. "I think so" Oliver said sheepishly, "although I don't know why, and when a Merfolk showed up at our camp 2 nights ago it didn't attck us so I don't understand". Nicolas for his part had stayed out of the conversation but now cut in, "Merfolk politics are something that we as pirates have learned to understand in the best way there is, which is to understand that you do not understand." "What does that mean?" Matias asked, "Just what I said," Nicolas responded, "why did the Merfolk attack Andmore and Orless, was it because this boy was there, yes, but why attack and not just ask for him to be handed over, certainly your Baron's would have happily given him over.", now it was Sofia's turn to cut in, "Destroying the grain stores in Andmore and the Wine stores in Orless, it's going to take years for the cities to recover, but think about it when we found Oliver he was nowhere near the cellars. It wasn't punishment for failing to turn him over, it wasn't an attempt to find him that spiraled out of control, it was a pre-emptive strike, and a big one at that." "Exactly" Nicolas added. The launch was now almost back to the shore and so he added "let us finish the conversation in my quarters for I fear something greater is at foot here and our fiend Oliver may know more than he is letting on."
On the Shadow Run Nicolas lead Matias and Sofia back to his cabin and started to fuss with a draw of rolled papers while he spoke "You mentioned Gregory Diamandis's tunnel, how you came to know of this is a mystery to me, but amongst pirates the lost tunnels are part of his legend.", "He was my, great grand uncle" Oliver said Sofia turned to him with a look of shock and a tone of anger, "I thought you said you weren't from this world?", "I'm not" Oliver responded defensively "he must have found a way into my world." Nicolas produced a map and unrolled it on the table it showed the coast and the Bay of Midwater leaving the land largely blank but providing detailed drawings of rocks and twisty inlets along the bay. "No one really believed someone like King Gregory was lost at sea, his ship was legendary for surviving even the worst storms" "And it could sail underwater" Oliver added remembering some of the taller sounding tales he'd read in the stories. "Ah, yes, there are rumours that he'd figured out the lost art to that, yes" Nicolas said with a chuckle, "Now", he gestured at the map, "where is this tunnel" Oliver tried to remember with enough detail where it had been marked on the map in the story, he did his best and pointed at roughly the right area. "I can't be sure" he added for safety "but I think it's about here, the story I read mentioned something about a pink and yellow rock where the cave entrance is, and you can only get in at low tide." Nicolas gave a toothy smile and said, "normally I wouldn't risk it, taking someone like you on board my boat, but if we sail now we'll make it to the cliffs by nightfall, the Merfolk rarely venture that far north into the bay so we should be safe. With that Nicolas stepped between Oliver and Sofia and headed out to shout orders at his crew and get the Shadow Run on it's way. Thinking about what it would take to find the cave and the tunnel, or even to survive the night if the Merfolk decided to attack Oliver thought of something that Valeria had told him back in the Shadow Lands. "Sofia?" he said, reaching into his pack and pulling the vial from it. Sofia looked at the vial with interest "this poition sends me back to my world, and I think when I take it I leave this world, do you think that would keep us safe and stop the Merfolk from attacking?" It was Matias who spoke first "You've have a way to go back home this whole time but you haven't taken it!" his tone was accusitory like it was Oliver who was choosing to come here and personally ordering the Merfolk attacks. "It doesn't stick does it?" Sofia asked Oliver, ignoring Matias's accusation. "No, whenever I fall asleep I come back here" Oliver said, glad that Sofia understood. "A poition like that is far beyond my skill, Oliver, but you say you leave this world when you take it and the Merfolk are after you then perhaps they won't attack. Although remember what Nicolas said, the only thing we understand about Merfolk is that we don't understand them so I don't know what they'll do." By now the Shadow run had gotten undersail and was starting to pick up speed and list to one side. Unsure of what to do next and feeling a bit queasy in the cramped cabin Oliver suggested "let's go above deck", Sofia and Matias aggreed and the three of them left the cabin behind.
The sail north was un-eventful. The Shadow Run dispite it's squat nature was a fast boat and seemed to quickly cover the distance that they'd walked in the 2 days previously. As they passed Orless they saw that while there were still boats crashed into the shore a lot of progress was already being made. The grand canal had been cleared, and the merchants canal. Boats were moored in the harbour but the army of barges and ferry seemed conspicuously absent. It was as Nicolas had predicted nearly nightfall when the reached the base of the black cliffs that rose a dizzying height out of the water and up to the summit of the mountain. By now the tide was almost at it's highest and with the fading light the sublte color of the rocks wasn't visible. There was no feasting and songs tonight just an all quiet order and lights trimmed low. Nicolas wanted shadow run to dissapear against the back rocks. Retiring to his bunk Oliver took out the vial of potion and drank it quickly, falling backwards.

#Chapter 21. Merstones and Pirate Tales
Oliver awoke in his bed. Sunlight had begun to filter in through his curtains and from downstairs he smelled breakfast cooking. Getting up he made a to-do list of the day, he needed to re-read the James the Pirate King stories that he'd gotten from his mom's cousin, and he'd wanted to study the merstone more now that he had a book about merfolk artifacts. He thought maybe of going back to the castle to see if there was anything else about James the priate king, or how Gregory Diamandis traveled from the island of Alland to his world. Heading downstairs he saw the fairly intriquite breakfast his mom was preparing. "Wow mom." Oliver said, "Yeah I thought a big saturday morning meal would be nice." his mom replied. Saturday? Oliver tried to put his days back in order. The time in Alland and the time here had started to run-together making it feel like it was well over a week since they'd visited the beach.
His Saturday it turned out was already fully planned. There was a summer carnival in the city and his Mom had planned a full day around it. They would attend the carnival getting lunch there and do some summer shopping that Grace was excited about followed by a nice dinner. The ride into the city was about 30 minutes on a nice day, but given the extra carnival traffic his Mom told them that that after breakfast they needed to head out since it could be an hour or so. Fearing that he'd fall alseep again in the car and return to Alland without even getting a chance to read the story of James the Pirate King again Oliver grabbed a can of coke and chugged it while he mother wasn't watching. He wasn't supposed to have sugary caffinated drinks, especially not in the morning, but he thought that being stuck traveling between worlds was a good reason to make an exception.
The carnival had all manner of people, most of the booths where there to sell something, soaps, artwork, dips, or food. There were also the sort of traveling rides that Oliver didn't really trust or enjoy, and the carnival games that everyone knew were just a scam to get your money. His mom insisted on the three of them going on an antique carosel that had been setup as part of the carnival. Oliver and Grace obliged because they know their mom would enjoy them all being together. After that they just wandered around to the various booths, it was wandering down a line of boring booths filled with brightly printed shirts, homemade all natural kitchen cleaner, and fancy olive oil that Oliver stopped studdenly. There in front of him, rendered in brightly colored ink on a white eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper was a Merfolk. It had long lanky limbs like the one he'd seen eyes buldging out and positioned too high up on it's fish like head, around it's neck a thin line suggested a chain of some kind and on it a black stone veined with white lines. "I'm going to go in here!" Luca said pointing at the booth. His mom pointed down the asile and said, "Ok your sister and I will keep going catch up to us when you're done". In booth was a small tent with walls on 3 sides, pictures on for display on all the walls. Some were of Merfolk in various poses. Another set of paintings showed the city of Orless from the water, another showed Andmore, there were still others with views of the Bay clearly painted from farms on the hills surrounding Orless. Across from the Merfolk were paintings of whales with what looked like tribal tattoos on them. A table was setup oposite the entrance with a large olive skinned man sitting behind it sketching something. Nervously Oliver approached him and asked, "Are those Merfolk from the island of Alland?" Looking up the man glanced over, put down his the rough pencil drawing of Oliver wasn't sure what, and got up from his chair "Let me check" he said, walking around the table he turned one of the drawings over read something on the back and said "Yeah, Merfolk of Alland, is what is says here. Are you familiar with Jason's work?" It took Oliver a minute to understand what the man was asking him. "You're not the artist?" he asked the man. "No, buddy of mine Jason draws these, we share a studio but he hates events like this so I put up his stuff in my booth - I drew those painting over there." The man gestured to the whales. "So Jason isn't here?" Oliver asked, "I wanted to talk to him about the drawings.", "Nah, but if you're interested in his work here's a card", the man grabbed a business card off the table and handed it to Oliver, "you can call him, email him, or the address for our studio is on there. He ahh... yeah he should be working there today." Oliver thanked the man and then turned to go, thinking about it for a second he turned to ask "How much are the drawings?" "Depends on the size, let's see here" he fumbled with some of the drawings, "yeah so something like this" gesturing at a large drawing of a Merfolk with a spear pointed agressively, "would be four hundred". "Oh, nevermind, thankyou" Oliver said turning to go. "Listen!" the man said as he turned, "No one ever comes in here asking about Tomas' work, how much you got and I'll see what we have?" Oliver looked in his wallet, he'd had some money saved for spending that summer and his mom had given him some money to spend at the carnival, "twenty five dollars" he offered sheepishly. The man grined at him "The important thing with collecting art" he said "is to start early, and buy pieces you love and can afford. Everyone makes a big deal about this or that painting that fetchs millions at auction but the true value to artwork is that you get to look at it whenever you want." with that he produced a stack of small postcard sized drawings. Showing merfolk, scenese of Orless, and others. "Tomas did these a while back, scanned some of his originals and had a local printer make them after I told him he needed something a bit more approachable. They're fifteen dollars each" Oliver flipped through them and pulled out one with a view of the bay from a terraced garden high up in the hills, it reminded him a bit of Carlos' farm, he also pulled out another one with a Merfolk swimming although it was on a field of white, it's lanky body seemed to move the way it was drawn. He considered the two options for a minute then went to go put the scene of the bay back into the stack. "Keep it", The man said, "I'll give you 2 for twenty five". "Thank you. Oliver said handing over the money. The man put both cards into a small paper bag and handed it back to Oliver.
Oliver caught up with his mom and sister at a game where you needed to shoot water into a clowns mouth to win a stuffed animal, he arrived just in time to see them lose and his sister to give a resigned sigh as she clearly wasn't going to get whatever prize it was she wanted. "Find anything?" his mom asked as the three of them kept walking, Oliver showed her the drawing of the merfolk "interesting" his mom said sounding unimpressed, then "oh that's beautiful" as he showed her the card with the drawing of the bay. "Where is it?" she asked, "The Island of Alland" Oliver said excitedly. "Really, like from Grandpa Gregory's pirate stories?" his mom seemed interested "Yeah turn it over" Oliver said, his mom did and there written in careful ink on the back it read "A view of the Bay of Midwater from high above Orless, art by Tomas Roberts". "I always thought Grandpa Gregory made up those stories" his mom said, "I wonder if the artist knew him, did you get a chance to talk to him?". "He wasn't there" Oliver said, "but I got his card I was wondering if we could go by his studio after lunch". He handed the buisness card to his mom. "It's not far, I guess we could go" she said. "But mom I wanted to go shopping" Grace protested finally joining the conversation. "The studio is in the old mill, there's a lot of good shops right there ok, we can do both" Grace was defeated but knew that making a fuss was not going to get her mom to agree to buy her a bunch of stuff so conceeded to the plan.
After grabbing some heavily fried food at some of the food vendors Oliver, Grace, and their mom headed out of the carnival and made their way over the river, there an old mill building stood. The mill had long since gone out of business and the building fallen into disrepair but now some enterprising locals had decided to turn it into a hip space for artists and shopping. All along the streets around it little boutiques had popped up featuring clothes, furniture, and various other hand crafts. Some of the smaller shops were closed today with signs reading "Find us at the carnival". In the mill building they took an old freight elevator up to the third floor and found a studio with two labels on it "Tomas Roberts" and "Kai Stevens". Heading in an older man was sitting at an easel sketching something in pencil. All around him were various drawings of merfolk, boats, and cities, all Oliver realized were scenes from Alland. His mom approched the man, "Hi I'm Diane Fletcher, I'm Gregory Diamandis's grand neice and I was hoping to ask you about some artwork that my son bought that you drew." Jason Roberts smiled, "Gregory Diamandis, that's a name that I haven't heard in a long time." "Did you know him?" Oliver's mom asked, "I knew of him" Tomas responded, "It's just, your artwork its from bed time stories that he used to tell me, I didn't think anyone else knew them." Tomas turned to Oliver "You found my artwork did you?" he asked, "Yes" Oliver answered, "What was it that drew you to it?" Tomas asked with an almost mysterious tone. His mom started to try to explain "He's been reading the pirate stories since he was interested in my Great Uncle after... Actually Oliver what was it that got you interested in Grandpa Gregory?" His mom turned to him, "I found a merstone on the beach" Oliver said his mom looked confused but Tomas' eyes shot wide open and his smile vanished. "A what?" his mom asked, trying to cover Oliver said "It's just a cool type of stone". Standing Tomas jumped into the conversation "I'd love to show your son around the sudio if he's interested in the artwork." "Yeah" Oliver was excited, hopefully this Tomas Roberts could help him figure out what was going on. "That's very nice of you" Oliver's mom said just then Grace piped in "Mom, I wanted to go shopping." "Listen", Tomas looked at Grace but addressed Oliver's mom, "Across the hall, 1 door down there's boutique shop, the man I share this studio with he has a daughter about your daughter's age and she loves everything there. If you want to take her shopping I'll show your son around here" Oliver's mom looked nervously at this strange man. "Look I promise we won't leave the studio" he said, "I just want to help you out." Reluctantly Oliver's mom agreed, she and Grace headed out.
"I have so many..." Oliver started but before he could finish the sentance Tomas cut in "Where did you find a Merstone?!" taken off guard Oliver answered quickly "At that beach like I said, I took it home with me and now whenever I go to sleep I wake up in Alland.", "And when you sleep there you wake up here?" Tomas' tone was almost excited, expectant. "No," Oliver said "I need to take a poition there to wake up here" "DAMN IT!" Tomas pounded the table, then realizing that the door was open and Oliver's mom was probably still within earshot he let out an overly loud "Sorry." It look Oliver a minute but said "You came here from Alland didn't you?", "Yes, like you I found a Merstone and after falling asleep I found myself here, but unlike you I don't have any potions to bring me back!" "How long have you been here for?" Oliver asked. Tomas paused for a moment then answered "40 years, I paint these from memory because everytime I go to sleep here I dream about that world. I just want those dreams to be real one night." The sorrow of those words hung over Oliver and Tomas for a long time. Finally Oliver jumped in "What do you think would happen if you touched my Merstone?" "Do you have it here?!" Tomas was excited, "No, but if you come by our house," Oliver thought for a moment, "Monday. I'll give it to you". "Well I've waited 40 years, what's 2 more days?" Tomas seemed releaved, Oliver quickly wrote down their address and handed it to Tomas. The artist thanked Oliver and in turn took one of the larger canvases with a view of Andmore from the sea and signed the back of it. "To ..." he paused for a second, "I never got your name?" "Oliver", "To Oliver, thank you for helping me on my long adventure home, and I hope you find the way". He handed the canvas to Oliver. "Now go catch up with your mother before she thinks I've abducted you" Tomas said nervously. Oliver left the store and found his mother and Grace at the boutique that Tomas had suggested. Much to his mothers dismay this was exactly the sort of place where Grace would want everything so she seemed relieved to have Oliver an an excuse to pay for things they'd picked out and go somewhere else.
The rest of the day was uneventful. Oliver had stashed the painting in their car being as it was too large to carry around. His mom having seen the size of it had initally wanted to go offer Tomas some money but found his studio closed. They ate a nice dinner at a small italian resturant near the mill and then headed home. Pulling into their street they were greeted by flashing red and blue lights, in front of their house were firetrucks and a police car. Oliver's mom stopped the car and said "Stay here let me see what's going on" she stepped out and approached the house, a police officer greeted her. Oliver couldn't hear what they were saying but after a few minutes she returned to the car. "There was a break in and some sort of explosion!" she said clearly shaken, "They said we can't go in tonight because they want to conduct an investigation, we're going to go check into a hotel and we can come by tomorrow to get clean clothes and things and figure out what to do.", "What do you mean explosion?" Grace asked. "I'm not sure." their mom said, "I think we'll have to see tomorrow.". Thinking about how Tomas had been in this world for 40 years Oliver wasn't exactly thrilled with waiting till tomorrow. "Can we get out and look at the house from here?" he asked. "I don't see why not" his mom confessed. Oliver and Grace climbed out of the car and the three of them asked the police officer if they could look around the outside of the house, "Don't touch anything, stay as far back as you can" he said. Staying as far from the house as they could they circled the yard. The front of the house looked fine except for a broken window. The back on the other hand was a different story, there were Oliver room was located a hole about 4 feet in diameter was open on the wall. It was almost perfectly round, and based on the way the siding on the house was bent it seemed to have been blown outwards by something in Oliver's room. Oliver thought about the Merstone, and wondered if it could have caused something like this.
It was late by the time they got into a cheap hotel room in town and crashed on their beds. Grace was in the bed with mom and Oliver got his own bed, they didn't have changes of clothes so they still wore what they'd been in all day. Oliver was nervous about what tomorrow would bring but he knew that for now he'd need to find the Pirate cave and the tunnel out of the bay before he could ever return here.

#Chapter 22. The Grotto
Oliver awoke on his bunk in the Shadow run and looked over to see Sofia staring at him. "Neat trick" there was a tone of awe in her voice as she said it, "how did it feel?", curious Oliver replied "Like waking up from a dream, how did it look?" "Like someone smashed a hole in reality and then pulled you through it, honestly I've never seen anything like it." The violent descrption put Oliver's mind back onto the track from his own world. "I need to go he said, I need to get back to my world again soon, something happened there" jumping out of the bunk he started to make his way to the door. "So you take another one of those potions and dissapear for another 5 hours?" Sofia's voice had a cutting tone to it. Of course Oliver thought the potion, he'd either have to go back to Andmore and Lucas and get another one, or else make his way back to Fedrick's farm to get the last one back from him. "I have to go see the Nicolas, he can take me to see Lucas." Oliver said, incoherrently again heading for the door. Again Sofia stopped him this time by quickly stepping between himself and the door. "You mad a deal with pirates Oliver, you don't just go around trying to change the terms of that deal, especially when they take a big risk having you on board. Why don't you calm down and tell me what happened." Oliver took a breath and realizing he wasn't going to get past Sofia gave the quick version of events trying not to add too many overly modern details. Finally getting to the end with the explosion her finshed with "... you see I have to go back so I wake up and get into my house." Sofia thought for a minute, then asked the question Oliver had never thought to ask, "How do you know the next time you take the potion you'll wake up and it will be time to go into your house?" "Because, whenever I take the potion I wake up and I've slept for the night" Although in the back of his mind as he said it he thought, that's not true though, the first time I took it I only slept about 40 minutes. His head started to spiral, how did time work between the wolrd, was it relative or completely disjointed. The minute he took to think was the opening the Sofia needed, "You promised me that you'd try to get free of this world, you promised those pirates you'd find them a way out of the bay, if you run from those promises you're going to find you have few allies standing behind you when the merfolk show up."
Oliver walked out onto the deck of Shadow Run, he had relented at least for a time in his desire to get back home. Outside the sun was just starting to break up the fog that lay thick over the bay and the sky was a deep dark purple color. The crew of the Shadow Run were already out and working, having prepared the winches they were getting ready to lower the rowboat into the water. Coming from out of his cabin Nicolas slapped a hand on Oliver's shoulder "Ready boy?" he asked, "Yes" Oliver said, he tried to remember the details of the stories that he'd read especially the original copy in the library. Climbing down the ladder to the rowboat and pushing off of the Shadow Run it was time to look for caves. In the boat were Oliver, Matias, Nicolas, and 2 of Nicolas's men who went by the names Dimitri and Angelo. Sofia had stayed back on the ship, "Not enough room in the row boat" was Nicolas's excuse but Matias had told Oliver what he really thought the reason was, "Make sure we don't try to double cross him". Shadow Run had anchored close to the cliffs so it was only a few minutes before they reached the cliff wall, even from where Shadow Run was anchored you could tell this section of the cliff face was pocked with caves, but up-close it was possible to see the full extent of these. "Tide is almost at it's lowest" Angelo said studying the rocks. Knowing that the window to enter the caves was closing fast Oliver started to scan the cliff wall. Almost at once he got excited as a section of rock below the water line seemed almost pink with a flecking of yellow. There a large cave opened that seemed as thought it would be hidden by the tide. "Let's try that one" Oliver said optimisticlly. The cave turned out to be a fairly shallow indent in the rock, not the pirate cave they were looking for. Dismayed Oliver scanned the cliff face and realized that the same pink and yellow rock continued along for several hundred feet, this section in particular seemed to have a large number of reasonable sized caves that would be mostly covered by the tide. As the Rowboat traveled along the cliff line Oliver resisted the urge to suggest exploring every cave, then all of a sudden he saw it. The cave itself would be completely hidden by the tide, the opening was almost perfectly round, and unlike the jagged openings of other caves seemed to be almost smooth.
The inside the cave was different than the pirate stories had described. The wide opening was short leaving little room even at low tide for their rowboat to enter, but beneath it was clear that the water was very deep. Inside the cave opened up to a large grotto. The ceilings were high above more than enough room for a ship the size of the Shadow Run to sit comfortably. The cave extended back into the mountain and widened as it did so. On the back wall the cave floor gently sloped out of the water and there were several small wooden buildings that seemed run down and abandoned. Supports suggested a bridge over a channel where the water lead off to a dark passage. This Oliver thought must be the tunnel. At Nicolas's command the rowboat made for the shore and scraped up onto the cave floor. Disembarking everyone looked around. There as a earie blue glow about everything as the sunlight outside filtered in through the water. "Angelo, take go back to Shadow Run and have them come closer, send as many men as you can carry on the row boat we need to see what we're dealing with." Nicolas's orders were hushed but echoed off the walls of the cave. Angelo climbed back into the rowboat and paddled back out the cave entrance soon dissapearing into the sunny sky beyond. "What do you think is here captian?" Dimitri asked, a note of greed in his voice. "Money, treasure maybe, but what I'm really intrested in... secrets". With that Nicolas lead the way up the the first of the buildings, Dimitri followed him. "Did you know this would be here?" Matias tried to whisper to Oliver, "No" Oliver's answer echoed faintly off the walls, "from the stories I expected a castle". "Ha!" Nicolas's laugh bounced and bounced around the large cave, turning to train his gaze on Matias and Oliver he added "this is a pirate castle, we don't build with stone, we build with the same timber that keeps us safe at sea." Nicolas turned back to the buildings and continued on, letting out a little soft laugh that echoed around the cavern. Matias started to follow and Oliver joined.
The search of the buildings took all day. Angelo had returned shortly with a boat full of Nicolas's men. The boat just barely was able to make the entrance to the cave. With the additional men they were able to quickly assess the stability of each structure and carefully look around. In one room under rotten floorboards they'd found a box filled with silver coin. In another they found casks that seemed dry. Other rooms held artifcats that hinted at their usage but had long since fallen apart due to the rot and mold. One large desk was clearly used for charting but all the maps had long been turned to dust. The tide was going out now and soon the entrance to the cave would open again. Nicolas took stock of their haul and called over one of his men leaning close to whisper something in his ear. The man beconned to a few more men who helped him push the rowboat loaded with silver and casks into the water. After that the man climbed in and rowed off to the cave entrance. "More of my men will return with supplies for the night." Nicolas annouced to Oliver and Matias as he rejoined the group where were still exploring the old buildings. "Tomorrow morning we set out" Nicolas said pointing at the entrance to the tunnel that Oliver assumed lead out to the northern sea. "How are you planning to get the Shadow run in here?" Oliver was curious if Nicolas had been holding out on him regarding his boats ability to sail underwater. "I'm not" Nicolas grinned, "those that have remained on the Shadow Run were busy building more small boats out of spare timber. The first group of us will take the rowboat and whatever else we've managed to build and head out. A second party will join us the following day. Now back to work" the last sentance was shouted not for Oliver's benefit but for the other men who it seemed had taken a break after seeing the rowboat head off. "Tell me Oliver", Nicolas brought his head in close, "You seem to know the secrets of Pirate King Gregory, where would he have stashed his most secrative treasure?" Oliver thought back to the stories he'd read, searching his mind for something. "There's a room" he recalled, "It was his private quarters in the cave, although he never said how he got there, just that it looked over everyone." "Interesting", Nicolas said considering the idea for a moment. His eyes scanned the ceiling of the cave and finally stopped near a rocky outcropping where a smaller cave branched off. "From there", Nicolas mused "you could see the whole cave."
Nicolas had quickly put his men to work finding the entrance to the secret room. Shortly after spotting it not one but 2 boats arrived bringing people from the ship they were quickly put to work to help in the effort. Aboard the rowboat was Sofia, no longer forced to stay aboard the boat she was to be in the first group to attempt the passage. "It's crazy out there" she said referring to the Shadow Run, "they're pulling up everything they can and building rafts. If this tunnel doesn't work out this Pirate king isn't going to have much boat left to sail". "If this doesn't work out he's not the pirate king anymore." Oliver said matter-of-factly, "finding a way out of the bay is how you become the pirate king in the first place." "Then why not start down the path now?" Matias asked looking at the attempt that was being made to get ropes up to the hidden room above. "Because he's a pirate, they're all about profit", Oliver felt like Sofia's sarcastic answer missed the mark a little, there was something about this whole endevor that was driving Nicolas more than just profit. Oliver thought about what Nicolas had said about the pirates giving up the ability to sail beneath the water, and what the stories of Gregorys time as a pirate had said about sailing boats underwater.
After a meal and more fruitless searching it became too dark to continue trying to access the hidden room above the cave. The pirates turned in, Sofia, Matias, and Oliver did the same falling to sleep quickly after the hard days work. Oliver slept restlessly his dreams tormented by images of dark clouds and raising water swallowing his town. He awoke to a world lit by a faint blue light similar to the stones that Valeria had activated back in the Shadow Lands. Sofia's hand was on his shoulder. "You were having a nightmare" she said a worried but reassuring look on her face. "Did you do this?" Oliver said gesturing to the light in the cave, "No, look." Sofia pointed towards the water. Here huge blooms of alge that had been ancored at the bottom all day had risen to the surface and were emitting light. "It's beautiful" Oliver said, "There's more, I'll show you" Sofia helped Oliver to his feed and took him over to one of the larger abandoned buildings. The foor here was covered in part with an alge like moss that also glowed. There on what seemed to be an unbroken floor Oliver could see a clear rectangle outlined by the glow, "The moss grows around the edge of a trapdoor, you can only see it when it's glowing" Sofia said reaching down and pulling the trapdoor open. "After you" she gestured to Oliver. "Shouldn't we wake Matias?" Oliver asked, nervious to go in. "Let him sleep, we can handle this" Sofia urged. Oliver giving in stepped into the hole in the ground and followed the short poorly lit path to a set of stairs. Oliver waited for Sofia and then they headed up together. The stairs rose and curved bringing them up around and eventually into a large room. The room was furnished in the same manner of a ships cabin. A bed, long since rotted away, and a desk that had held up in remarkable shape. Crossing to the desk Oliver opened it and produced a map, it showed a long curvy path with numbers skeched along it. "Probably depth soundings for the tennel" Sofia added quickly. She examined te desk closly. "as I expected, this is enchanted, but by someone with a far finer hand than I'm ever likely to possess." She said. They looked through other papers until Oliver revealed one with an illustration of a boat. "Here I think this may be what he's looking for!" he said excitedly. Sofia looked at the page, "I can't read it, what do you think it says". The writing was a odd curly script with a heavy block shape on top of the letters. It looked familar to Oliver but he wasn't sure where he'd seen it. Then all of a sudden he remembered the the book he'd taken from the guild hall. Unshouldering his bag onto the table he opened it and produced the book Merfolk Artifacts. flipping past the first few pages he came to table showing the same type of lettering, thick on top curley on the bottom, and a rough tranlsation to the human writing systems. "This has got to be it!" Oliver said, "It's how Gregory Diamandis got his ship in here and down that tunnel, and how he became such a great pirate, it's..." but before he could explain Sofia cut him off placing a hand over his mouth. Once he'd stopped talking she led them over to where the cave opening was like a window to look out on the cave from. There familiar silloettes emerged from the glowing water, Merfolk.
Oliver could make out atleast 2 dozen Merfolk making their way silently through the rocky shore where the pirates slept. As they emerged from the water Oliver noticed the large spears that they carried with them. Suddenly there was a flash of red light - Sofia had shot some sort of enchantment into the cave - she pulled him down below the cave opening just before a loud BOOM echoed throughout the cave and the floor shook slightly. Without looking at the result Sofia started to move to the stairs back to the cave with a quick "stay hidden, here" to Oliver as she left. Peeking his head up and looking down into the cave Oliver could see that several of the Merfolk who were previously up above the water had been knocked back by the explosion, but the otherwise it seemed to not have done much damage. Then Oliver realized what Sofia had done, woken by the explosion the pirates were starting to rally and draw their swords, the Merfolk had planned to a surprise attack but all of a sudden they were facing an enemy ready to fight. The Merfolk who were out of the water started a charge but their speed and power in the water was useless on the slippery cave rock where the tide had started to go out. As they initally stumbled the pirates were able to knock a few Merfolk back into the water. Eventually making their way up onto the rocky shore a all-out melee commenced with spear clashing against sword. The Merfolk with their lanky frames and long spears had the reach but on the defensive the pirates shorter blades were excellent at parrying all the incoming blows harmlessly away. All of a sudden bolts of red light struck 3 of the Merfolk clean in the chest knocking them back into the water motionless. Sofia had made it back into the cave and joined the fight. The sudden shock of those magic bolts gave some of the pirates an opening and they were able to parry forward and land blows on the merfolk. It was looking the pirates would be able to drive them back. Then from the water more merfolk emerged to join the fight and all of a sudden the tight line of pirates that had been standing united began to break up.
Suddenly Oliver remembered the small white rock that he'd tucked into his bag, running to it he fumbled around and found it sitting there at the bottom. Clutching it with both hands he thought to himself, "I need your help, save my friends". He quickly ran to the cave window again slipping the rock into his pocket. In the melee below Sofia was a sight to behold, quick flashes of light sparked from her hands knocking down Merfolk who got close to her while she let out a few more of the volleys that seemed to swerve through the air to find their targets. She had made a b-line for Matias who was expertly taking on 3 merfolk. Having reached him they seemed to immediately fall into perfect sync, Oliver remembered that they'd fought together back in Orless and this must be a result of that. The two of them were shoulder to shoulder turning in what looked like a coreographed dance, sword parrying spear then a flash of light finding the opening left behind. The 3 merfolk fell rapidly, but Sofia didn't stop, seeing a group of merfolk who were starting to overwhen 2 pirates she let out another volley of red energy blasting the merfolk to the floor. Matias saw the main thrust of the fighting had moved away from them and went to go join, but Sofia became fixated on the merfolk still coming ashore. Walking towards the waterline she blaste merfolk one after another but there were too many of them and soon she had to start inching backwards to keep herself from being surrounded. Taking a step backwards Oliver saw Sofia slip, she was able to fire off a bolt of energy to stop a Merfolk who ran at her with a spear but she was clearly outmatched. All of a sudden Matias slammed into one of the large merfolk flanking Sofia hacking at him with a sword. Grabbing Sofia's arm he pulled her up and away from fight. Meanwhile Captain Nicolas had gathered a group of pirates together and began to cut there way through any merfolk that stood between them and the boats that had been pulled ashore. The group moved with an unwavering determination and Oliver could see behind them a line of fallen merfolk and pirate alike. Reaching the boats Nicolas rallied his men and they started to get the boats into the water. Still more merfolk kept coming from the water to join the fight and what had initally seemed to be going in the pirate's favor now looked like it could be lost. Enough pirates had made it to the 2 small boats that captain Nicolas sent the smaller one away, it headed out into the water and quickly turned for the tunnel entrance. Oliver noticed then that the light from the seaweed had dimmed, looking into the water a large dark shape was visible beneath the water. From his vantage point he could see bubbles forming and then all of a sudden a ball of fire shot into the sky and flew straight at Matias and Sofia. Seeing the flame Sofia was able to quickly knock back a merfolk that was coming towards them and then with a wave of her arms a blue flash of light swirlled in a wide circle around her meer seconds before the fireball slammed into it and exploded. The explosion knocked them back, Matias recovered quickly, scrambling over to where Sofia was laying, she didn't seem to move and Oliver watched as he hoisted her up and over his shoulders and started to make his way to the remaining boat. In an instant Oliver realized that if he stayed hidden up here the boat would leave and he'd be stuck in this cave, he immediately ran to the stairs and took them as fast as possible back to the cave. Emerging from the secret passage Oliver saw Matias and Sofia had almost reached the boat, with the added weight it was slow going, having recovered from the shock of the blast a number of merfolk were now trying to stop them but they'd been intercepted by a group of pirates. Oliver tried to run to catch up but even the dry rock in the cave felt precarious. Just then another fireball emerged from the water, this one headed for the small boat that Nicolas was defending from a group of merfolk. He shouted something and quickly shoved the boat into the water and then dove in himself before, BOOM! The fireball hit and threw Oliver to the ground he felt his head hit rock hard and then everything went black.

#Chapter 23. The Storeroom
Oliver awoke with his head pounding and his vision blury. He could tell the room he was in was dark and judging by the feel of the floor beneath his feet he wasn't in the cave anymore. He wiggled his arms and found they couldn't move, then realized they were tied to... The fog he was in started to lift and he realized that he was sitting up tied to a chair. The room was still dark but he could start to make out the shapes of shelves stacked full of crates and barrels. He couldn't tell much about the room itself, it's walls were too far away to see clearly, and it's ceiling far over head to make out in the dark. Suddently the room started to brighten a light behind Oliver caused him to cast a faint shadow. The shadow wavered as if the light was moving and grew darker as the light got closer. Then from his left two men carrying torches passed him and moved to the edge of shelves where the light illuminated small metal holders that the torches were placed into. Then from behind him Oliver heard heavy steps slowly moving forward, unable to turn he waited until coming around from behind him a large merfolk lumbered and stopped in front of him. The merfolk was tall like the others he'd seen, however unlike the lanky merfolk who he'd seen attacking Orless or the pirate cave this one was rotund.
"So you're the boy everybody wants?" the merfolk's voice was deep but horse and quiet. Oliver's head still felt hazy and it seemed like even as he tried to talk his mouth wouldn't work. "Still a bit out of it, eh?", the merfolk's deep voice picked up a higher note and almost chuckled, "Not surprising, when we pulled you out of that cave you seemed like you'd taken quite a fall." Oliver thought about the cave - "What happened to my friends?!" he nearly shouted the question. "Those dead pirates? That wasn't my doing - they brought that attack on themselves trying to find a way out to the northern sea - but I'm not in the business of attacking pirates, no profit in that." again that little chuckling like tone at the end gave Oliver the sense that the Merfolk found the statement funny. "What are you in the business of?", the question seemed to just simply come out of Oliver's mouth. "Ha", another chuckling tone this time the explicit laugh seemed to suggest that this was in fact something funny, "I'm in the business of hot commodities, and you seem to be quite the hot commodoity." more chuckling. "So you're going to sell me?" Oliver's question carried a weight of indignation. "Not just yet - Look around, this is my storehouse where I keep wines and various goods that I know will be worth more in the future, you're no different.", he paused and smilied, "Now this...", the merfolk held up the illusive pelt cloak that Oliver had been wearing, "this tells me that you have some information about the shadow lands, and right now information like that is a truely hot commodity. So for now you'll stay in my storehouse and give me whatever information you have, and when that information runs out I'll think about how you can make me the most profit." With that the merfolk started to walk back to the door behind Oliver. Oliver knew that if he stayed in this storehouse he wouldn't ever figure out how to get home, quickly he blurted out "Wait!". Ther merfolk stopped and turned to Oliver, "Yes?" Oliver thought quickly and remembered Lucas' journal, wrapped up in a old bag and stashed at Carlos' farmhouse, "I have a book with information about the Shadow lands, tons of information" the Merfolk looked intriged, "Where is this book?". Oliver looked at the 2 men who had come in with the torches, they had stood back during the conversation but he noticed now that they were wearing light armour and had swords on their belts, he imagined that if he told the merfolk where the book was it would be people like these men who were sent to fetch the book. "I won't tell you but I will show you." Oliver hoped the gamble would pay off. "Ah, a negotiator, I like this.", again the smile from the Merfolk as he continued, "There are powerful forces within the kingdom that would like nothing more to see you dead" he let the word sit for emphasis, "there are others that would prefer you alive, but if I'm seen helping you it's not going to matter, they'll both hate me. So for my safety you're going to stay here in this storehouse." "Then you'll never get the book!" The merfolk became visibly frustrated, "Maybe I don't need you to tell me where it is, after all I know quite a bit about you. 11 days ago you were in Andmore for the coronation then 5 days ago you show up in Orless, I know you didn't sail there, so you must have traveled through the shadow lands which means that crazy sorcerer Lucas helped you. It's his book you're offering me right? Of course it is, where else would you get a book on the Shadow Lands? I don't think you're stupid enough to believe you can walk into Castle Andmore and just leave with one of Lucas' books, which means he gave it to you, probably as a guide for the journey. Then you make it through the shadow lands and decide you don't need this guide anymore, at least not yet, so you stash it at one of those quaint farms to the north of Orless, someplace only you can find it. How did I do?" the merfolk paused and Oliver's mind raced, he felt like his only chance of escape lay through convincing the merfolk that it was only him that could take him to this book, then he realized - a mostly truthful answer, one that would check out if someone cared enough to check it. "You're wrong about the book", he lied "I assume you know I visited the sorcerers guild in Orless and was banished, what you don't know is that I came back to the city that night and broke into the guild library." Oliver let the implication hang, and he could tell by the merfolk's face that his idea was working. "And so you stole this book from them?" "I took everything I could carry" Oliver replied - truthfuly. The merfolk took a moment but then smiling said "you win, in the morning you show my men where the book is." With that the merfolk gestured and headed out of the room. The two guards who had proceeded him followed, leaving one of the torches behind. Oliver was left alone he wiggled but found that he couldn't seem to free himself from the bonds. After what seemed like hours one of the guards returned and untied him then grabbing the remaining torch led Oliver to the door and up a series of stairs. Finally opening the door into a small room.
The room was barely furnished but it had a bed and on the bed was a bowl of what looked like porage - Oliver hadn't thought about eating but looking at the food now he realized how hungry he was. The guard spoke in a gruff voice "Boss says that if you cooperate you can stay up here and he'll make sure that you're not harmed, if you try anything he knows a few people who would be more than happy to make him rich for the chance to kill you." with that the guard left Oliver alone in the room and departed. Oliver sat on the bed and ate the porrige then left the bowl on the foor laying down he felt exhaused by the last few days events. Dead pirates is how the merfolk had described his friends, Oliver remembered seeing the explosion but had they really not made it out of the cave after that, or had the explosion killed everyone? Either way he'd need to get to the cave to find the real answer, and if they had survived he'd need to make his way though the tunnel to the shadow lands to find them. That night Oliver lay awake in bed and formulated a plan to escape from this merfolk and finish his quest.
The morning light streamed in around the closed shutters and struck Oliver's face waking from the light sleep he'd fallen into. Raising he walked to the window and tried to open the shutters but found they were barred from the outside and could only open a few inches. Peering through the gaps Oliver tried to make out where he was. It took only a second for him to recognize the telltale building facades mounted along the cliff face beside them making it clear he was above one of the warehouses along the merchants canal. A knock at the door and another man this one dressed in simple clothes opened it, "Time to go." he said. They decended stairs and exited onto the canal street and into the sun where 2 more men joined them, these men looked more like the men from last night. Armed and wearing a light armor. The first man gestured to Oliver as if you say "lead on" and Oliver lead the way towards the merchant's gate.
Exiting the city they began the long climb up the road to Carlos' farm, along the way everyone was mostly silent. The ride into town with Carlos had been easy but they'd also been in a cart and going downhill, now on foot and going up the steep winding roads it seemed to take forever. They stopped near midday after getting a ways up the mountain and the first man got some dried food out of his pack for everyone to eat. "How far to this hiding place?" he asked after Oliver had eaten some of the food. Oliver was thankful to be eating but not stupid enough to answer that question, instead asking one of his own. "What are those men going to do when I show you where everything is hidden?" the man glared back at him, then annouced to the group, "Let's keep moving." As they got on their way Oliver saw the ruins of a farm perched up on the hill above them. The front of it with the stone pillars where a veranda would have overlooked the bay seemed familiar. Curious he asked the man, "What is that place?" the man looked at it for a minute and then responded "Roberts' farm, people say it's haunted, been abandonded for many years." Something about the farm unsettled Oliver, he didn't remember seeing it on his way down and the whole place gave off an earie sense. Not wanting to dwell on it Oliver hurried along and the group quickly climbed the rest of the distance to Carlos' farm.
By the time the reached the farm it was almost supper time, the air was filled with the smells of various home cooking, and Fredick's little farm house was no different. Oliver approached and decided to simply knock on the door. Carlos opened and his eyes went wide then he hugged Oliver, "I thought you'd died in the attack!" he said, "I didn't, I'm just here to get the stuff I left." Oliver added awkwardly. Carlos looked at him and the 3 men behind him especially the two armed men then nodded. "Give me a minute." with that Carlos dissapeared into the house and returned a few minutes later with the bag Oliver had left packed. He handed it to Oliver and then before Oliver could even say thankyou Carlos gave him another hug, as it did Oliver felt something drop into his pocket. As Carlos pulled back Oliver offered a simple "Thanks", Carlos nodded and Oliver turned to go on his way. As the door shut behind him the man reached out his hand expecting Oliver to give him the bag. Oliver thought for a minute about what he would do and reached his hand into his pocket. There he felt the small glass vial, the one he'd left behind. Carlos had removed it from the bag and slipped it to him, weather he knew what it did or he just knew how enchantments worked and hoped for the best Oliver would never know. He handed the bag over and watched as the man removed the staff, examining it and then handing it to one of the guards, and then the diary. This he leafed through quickly. "Where's the rest of it?" the man asked turning to Oliver, "That's it" Oliver said matter-of-factly. "I was told it would be lots of books, taken from the Sorcerers library!", "That's all the information on the shadowlands", Oliver replied adding, "If your boss wants me to give up the rest of the information we'll have to have a talk about that" The man nodded and again gestured for Oliver to lead the way back to town.
Walking slightly ahead of the group Oliver reached into his pocket and grasped the vial, waiting for a turn in the road he quickly pulled it out, popped open the stopper and drank the vial, he head a voice behind shouting "Hey!" before he felt his legs collapse under him.

#Chapter 24. Home
Oliver awoke in the hotel, his mom was already awake holding the phone to her ear, and he heard her whisper "Ok, we'll be by then". She hung up and turned to Oliver. "Good news!" she said with a muted smile, "After we get some breakfast we can go back to the house and get things.", "We can't stay at the house though?" Oliver asked knowing the answer already, "No, not yet, and besides you saw it yesterday, there's quite a large hole in your bedroom, probably not the best place to spend the night." Oliver thought about sleeping on the side of the southern road by a campfire and his bedroom even with a large hole in it didn't seem so bad but he nodded his head in agreement. "Now let's wake your sister up and go get some food"
It was still early morning when they arrived at their house, a police officer was sitting in his car waiting outside, when he saw them pull up he climbed out. Together with the police officer they all entered the house. "Now you're just here to get what you need for a few days, ok, we haven't finished our investigation so try to touch as little as possible." The officer said in a calm voice as the entered. Just through the frontdoor Oliver could see into the living room where broken glass from the smashed window glittered from the sofa. Staying together they all went into the basement and grabbed a few small suitcases from the shelves along the wall, lugging them back up to the second floor they went first into Grace's room tossing clothes and various accessories into her suitcase. Then their moms room, doing the same, finally it was into Oliver's room. Stepping into the room it was like a bomb had gone off. Everything was knocked aside. On the floor from the bookshelf to the wall was what looked like a burn mark, in the mark their seemed to be faintly visible the silliot of a person, although stretched out like a shadow right as the sun is setting. Trying not to pay attention to the burn they packed Oliver's suitcase, then the officer pulled Oliver's mom aside of a minute before turning back to Oliver. Their mom said to "Grace, why dont' you got get our tooth brushes, Oliver and the officer need to talk about some things here" Grace had a look on her face that made Oliver thing she was terrified of what the talk was going to be but headed out to the bathroom anyway. "Look son!" the officer said addressing Oliver after Grace had left, "The explosion seemed to start from right about here." The officer pointed at Oliver's bookshelf with a pen he'd taken from his pocket. There on the bookshelf Oliver saw the little pewter figure of a knight, and next to it, the merstone. "What I need to know is if you had anything in here that wasn't just a toy, anything someone gave you to hold on to, anything at all?", Oliver thought about trying to explain the merstone to the officer but he remembered the skeptisism that Steven had shown at his story and decided it best not to try to explain, "No" he said flatly, "Are you sure son, you're not in trouble if you did, we just need to know what caused this and if there's anything else that could explode around here?", this time Oliver was more emphatic, shaking his head and saying "No." The officer wrote something down quickly in a notepad and then turned to their mom and said "Alright, best be getting out of here then and letting the forensics team have at it." The police officer turned to lead Oliver and his mom out of the room. With his back turned Oliver crossed over to the bookshelf to examine the merstone, it was exactly as he'd left it sitting next to the pewter knight, but looking behind him Oliver could see that it was clearly at the center of a blast that had blown a huge hole in his wall. He thought about reaching out and taking the merstone when behind him the officer's voice cut in "You sure you don't remember anything there?" Oliver turned, his mom had left the room but the officer was standing in the door watching him. "No, sir" Oliver said and headed out, leaving the Merstone behind.
Oliver's mom had made plans for him to stay at Steven's house for the night, and Grace to stay at a friends. She was going to crash at a coworkers house that night and in the morning she'd be meeting with a contractor to see if they could get back into their house. Grace was dropped off first, and then Oliver got dropped off at Steven's Oliver's mom thanked Steven's mom who shrugged it off, "It's horrible what happened, I'm just glad you're all alright." she said. Steven and Oliver hung out, played video games, and then after lunch went out for a bike ride, Steven finally addressed the elephant in the room that had been hanging over them. "So, do you know what happened?" he asked Oliver, "I don't know, but I think it has something to do with that rock I told you about, the Merstone" Steven looked skeptical. "Do you want to check it out?" Oliver asked, "Can we?" Steven seemed shocked like he thought this would be some impossibility. Oliver lead the way and they biked back to Oliver's street, there at the end of the road they saw several police cars and a few other cars pulled off to the side. "I've got an idea, come with me" Oliver said turning his bike and starting to head away from his house. "I don't know," Steven responded, "It looks really serious Oliver, don't you think we should just go do something else?" Oliver shook his head, although he wasn't sure if Stven could see it, then turned them both down another side street and rode along past the houses until he got to a small blue house. No car was in the drive way, "Come on!" Oliver said turning into the driveway and then hopping off his bike as he reached a wooden gate the opened into the backyard. He pulled on the latch and the gate opened easily and he pushed his bike with him as he walked in. Hesitantly Steven followed.
The backyard was fenced in on all sides but diagonally across there was another gate, Oliver and Steven crossed the grass to it pushing their bikes, then went throught the gate which opened to a small wooded area. Here there was a large pile where grass clippings from a lawn mower had been dumped, and beyond that thicker trees. Oliver pushed his way into the trees and quickly realized that it would be impossible to take his bike any further, leaving it behind he used both hands and was able to push his way into the woods. The wooded area itself wasn't very large but was densly populted with trees, making it hard to walk, still Steven and Oliver were able to push their way though until the trees started to thin, through the branches Oliver could see his neighbors house, turning they walked through the woods some more until the back of his house was clearly visible. A Police officer was standing outside in the backyard but he had his back turned to the woods and was looking at the house. "See", Oliver pointed to where his room was, the large hole clearly visible. "Wow!" Steven said seeing the size of the hole and the roundness of it. Just then the officer's radio went off with a static buzz, Oliver could hear words that sounded like "All set!" without taking his eye off the house the officer left the backyard and circled around to the front. Oliver gestured to Steven and without waiting for him pushed through the trees into the backyard and quickly ran to the back of his house. Steven was just behind him with a mortified look on his face "We're not supposed to be here!" he whispered to Oliver, "Don't worry, we'll be careful" Oliver replied. Then he inched his way along the wall of the house till he came to a window into the kichen that was low enough to look in. Peaking through the window he could see people in white suits that looked like the kind you'd use for painting walking down the stairs and heading towards the door in the hallway beyond. Inching further along Oliver tried the backdoor into the kitchen but found it locked. Futher along still Oliver tried the cellar door - also locked. Next to the cellar door was a wrap around porch, pokeing his head around the side of the house Oliver could see that people were getting in their cars and leaving. Oliver gestured to Steven to stay put, then croached down to avoid being seen and went to the porch steps that lead into the backyard. There at the bottom of the steps he moved a large rock and fished out the key that was hidden underneath. Quickly crossing back he unlocked the cellar door and he and Steven entered the basement.
In the basement Oliver and Steven could hear the footsteps on the floors above, as well as the occasional murmmer of voices but he couldn't make out what anyone was saying. They crossed to the front of the house where small cellar windows let in some light and where you could just make out the road obscured by bushes. They listened quietly and at last the footsteps seemed to stop, they heard a door close and could just make out someone walking out to a car parked on the street. Oliver lead the way upstairs into the kitchen and then up to his bedroom. The room looked exactly as it had that morning. The huge hole blown in the wall and the stuff strewn everywhere. Crossing to the shelves Oliver saw that the merstone and pewter knight were still there. Steven looked at the floor and then orienting himself stood such that his back was at the hole and he faced the shelf. "Someone was here!" he said, "Yeah I know trying to get this I think." Oliver grabbed the Merstone and held it up for Steven to see. "Can I see it?" Steven asked, "You can't touch it!" Oliver replied, "When I touched this it started to take me to Alland, and whoever was in here tried to touch it and it blew them up" Steven's hand retreated a bit clearly worried he was going to get blown up. Just then the boys heard the font door open and heavy steps entered the house. Loudly a radio crackled and they could hear a staticy voice "Just need one more sweep of the boy's room ok!" then the voice of the police officer from this morning replying back "Ten four". "Come on" Oliver whispered, pocketing the merstone and pulling a horrified Steven into his small closet and shutting the door behind them. The footsteps below got louder, the boys could just barely hear them over their breathing and the pounding of their hearts. Then a creak as the polic officer stepped on the first stair. Steven's breathing was rapid and Oliver worried he was going to hyperventilate. "Shh." he whispered squeezing Steven's hand a little. They could hear the footsteps continuing up the stairs and then crossing the hall. Oliver held his breath and Steven did the same, as the heavy footsteps entered the room the pounding of Oliver's heart seemed deafening. The footsteps crossed into the room, stopping, then moving again, to where the hole was in the wall, and then stopping again, then to the shelf. Oliver reached into his pocket with his free hand and felt the merstone he'd taken off the shelf - stupid - Oliver thought, the police office would notice the missing stone and then how hard would it be to find the boys hiding in the closet. The steps started again this time approaching the closet door. Oliver felt like his heart was about to explode, then a crackle of static, "report?" the voice on the radio asked. Oliver heard a click and then the officer's voice "All clear here." With that the footsteps turned and left the room. Oliver and Steven let out sighs of relief. As the footsteps decended the stairs with the tell tail creak, creak they opened the closet door and steped into the bedroom. "Thank god!" Steven said quietly, "I thought they were going to catch us for sure". Oliver nodded listening as the loud steps walked downstairs and then they heard the door shut only then did he turn to Steven and say "We should go". Steven nodded quickly and the two boys quickly and quietly went back downstairs to the basement, back through the cellar door. Being sure to lock it and, Steven insisted, return the key to the hiding place. And then ran back to the to the woods and back to their bikes.
Getting back to Steven's house was uneventful and they arrived in time for dinner before heading up to Steven's room to hang out for the night. There they got to talking about their adventure and miraculous escape. "So who do you think was there?" Steven asked, "I don't know", Oliver responded then thinking for a mintue asked "Can I borrow your phone?". Oliver and Steven went downstairs, Steven's mom was doing dishes and his brother was watching TV so no one really paid them any attention as they picked up the phone, Oliver fished into the pockets of the clothes he'd been wearing since yesterday, his hand brushed against the merstone but then he found the business card he'd gotten from the artist. Tomas Ruiz and Kai Stevens, then below the names a phone number, the boys dialed it. The phone rang for a few minutes before it was picked up. "Hello?" Oliver recognized the voice as Kai, the man he'd met at the carnival the day before. "Is Tomas there?" Oliver asked, "No, who's asking?", Kai's tone seemed strained, "Oliver, I talked to you yesterday at the carnival. Have you seen him today?", "Oh, yeah" Kai's tone was relaxed, "actually I'm wondering if you ended up going to see him, you know he wasn't here all day and he left a really weird note to me.", "I saw him yesterday, after I talked to you" Oliver told Kai, "Well then you're the one who saw him last, let me ask you anything odd when you talked to him?" "No, nothing why, what did his note say?", "It just said, 'thanks for everything I'm headed back', doesn't mean anything to you right?" Oliver's heart sank, he remembered what Tomas had said to him before 40 years he'd been here, and Oliver had given the man his address so he could come by monday to see the merstone. He remembered back on the road, the Ruiz's farm, long destroyed, long abandoned, and haunted, and then he remembered the pillars on that veranda and the small postcard he'd bought with the view of the bay from Kai the day before. "Doesn't mean anything to me, thanks!" Oliver said and hung up the phone. "What is it?" Steven asked, he'd heard the conversation but without the context it didn't mean anything to him. "Not here."Oliver whispered and they returned to Steven's bedroom to discuss what they'd learned.
After giving Steven the full rundown of the day before and the days spent in Alland they started to form a plan. Going to sleep tonight Oliver would wake up there on the road in Alland, how much time would have passed they weren't sure but hopefully it was long enough that the men who were guarding him had moved on. From there he'd go and check out the Ruiz's farm and see what he could learn. If that was where Tomas Ruiz had fallen alseep all those years ago maybe there was another merstone there, although after seeing the state of his room Oliver wasn't sure what he'd do if he found it. From there the plans got hazy. Oliver knew he was out of potion so to get back here he'd either have to figure something out of find Lucas and get him to make more. Oliver had remembered how Carlos had recieved a message from Lucas so maybe he had a way of getting in touch with him and they could find a way. Eventually it grew very late and the boys fell alseep unable to keep themselves awake any longer.

#Chapter 25 Ruins
Oliver awoke in the middle of the road, it was dark out, clearly he'd been away for several hours. Standing he decided that instead of going to the Ruiz's farm he'd go back to Carlos' he'd be able to sleep there get word to Lucas and then explore the ruins of the farm in the morning. Turning and heading back up the road he saw in the distance a faint glow of orange fire, running a bit he got closer to where the farm house had stood and realized that it had been set a blaze. He thought about the guards that had come with him and imagined what must have happened when he'd dissapeared from right in front of them. Worried that they may be waiting for him to come back to the farmhouse still he turned and headed of to the Ruiz's farm. It was dark but the road was worn smooth by all the carts that had traveled it so he felt sure footed and was able to walk at a good speed. As he walked he wondered if they had questioned Carlos and if so what he'd told them, what could he tell them, was he ok. Oliver put the thoughts out of his mind and set his focus to finding out all he could about the Ruiz's farm.
The farm itself had become horribly overgrown but low walls of the farm building still stood giving the sense of the place. It was no longer quite so pitch black as it had been when he'd first awoken and now looking out on the bay from the broken down veranda Oliver could see that this was in fact the same scenes that Tomas had painted back in his world. Oliver imagined him finding the Merstone on the beach below and then taking a look out onto the bay before going to bed. The last look he'd get of the bay in 40 years, and one that clearly stuck with him. The farmhouse itself was small with just a few rooms. Oliver understood why people thought this place was haunted, there was something clearly not right about it something that felt like it wasn't meant to be here. He found a room that he imagined would have been a bedroom, it was located at the back of the house. The thick trees that had long since invaded the property crept right up to the reminants of the outside wall. Here Oliver saw stones all along the floor, covered with moss and flowers, he imagined the ceiling must have caved in, and hopefully underneath the rubble there would be something to find. Working carefuly he started to shift aside rocks and pile them off to one side of the room. It was after moving a few of these that Oliver felt the hairs on the back of his neck raise, looking up and into the trees he saw two glowing eyes, and could just make out in the half light the long fangs of a shadow cat.
Oliver froze but without his illusive cloak the cat saw him clearly it padded forward another foot and then jumped easily clearing the remains of the outter wall. Without thinking Oliver dove away just as the cat landed silently where he had been kneeling a minute before. The stone he had been moving was still in his hand and so Oliver turned to the cat and threw the stone at him. It struck the cat in the back but didn't seem to do much more than enrage it. Scrambling backwards Oliver watched as the cat turned to him and lowered itself into a deep croach getting ready to pounce. Moving back further Oliver found his back up against one of the walls and was trapped. The cat sized him up and then yelped loudly. It turned it's head and body to look towards the ocean and Oliver could see from it's rear leg a shaft was sticking out. Then all of a sudden a large spear flew through the air and slammed into the cat's chest knocking him back to the floor and leaving him motionless. A tall merfolk appeared at the ruined wall, easily towering over it. He assessed the cat and then turned to Oliver. From the soft features Oliver thought he recognized this Merfolk as the same one who had met him on the road that night after leaving Orless, the one who had given him the stone. Climbing over the wall the merfolk twisted the spear in the shadow cat and pulled it out, the cat didn't move - clearly dead, then the merfolk grabbed the smaller spear that had been lodged in the cat's back leg and turned to Oliver. Oliver was terrified but unable to move, the merfolk took a step closer and then said in that same soft and quite voice "You lost this" he was holding in his hand the white stone he'd given Oliver that night on the road.
After helping Oliver to his feet the two of them moved out to the ruined veranda. "I came to the grotto", the Merfolk said, "But you were gone, although you'd dropped this rock." Oliver rememberd putting it in his pocket but then he guessed it must have fallen out when the explosion had knocked him back. "You're not the easiest human to track, but you do leave a mark whenever you move between worlds, lucky for you." the merfolk gestured to the dead shadow cat. "What are you doing in this place anyway?" the merfolk asked his tone had a feeling of distaste to it. "I'm looking for something" Oliver left the answer vauge, while this merfolk had saved him he wasn't so sure about him otherwise, after all it was when he'd used that stone that the attack in the cave seemed to really ramp up. "The travel stone, you won't find it here." The reply was unexpected caught Oliver off guard, "how do you know?" he asked wondering how the merfolk knew that was what he was looking for. The merfolk sat on a large rock and turned to Oliver looked what Oliver assumed was seriously at him, "Magic powerful enough to allow you to move between the worlds, that is rare stuff. I'm impressed Lucas was able to get the potion to send you back to your world right, but compared to the power it takes to get here in the first place it's nothing. Only one such Merstone has ever been imbued with that power, it was made as a weapon for a war that was thought inevitable, but it was lost, some say stolen and we now know washed ashore near here and was found by a young Tomas Ruiz, a young farm boy intrigued with pirate tales and longing for adventure. He bonded to the stone in a way that only you humans seem able to do and brought it back home. I suspect you know what happened when he went to sleep that night?", "He spent 40 years in my world, before, well, blowing up I guess?" Oliver said, "40 years, interesting...", the merfolk muesed and Oliver looked on, addressing Oliver once again the merfolk continued, "You know of course that time does not pass in your world and our world the same way. Well let me tell you the rest of this story. You see one hundred years ago young Tomas went to sleep in this farm and when he didn't awake for his chores his mom went in to rouse him, that is when the explosion happened. People were terrified of the farm and thought it haunted and cursed almost immedately, except one, someone I believe you know, Gregory Diamandis. The pirate king whose exploits Tomas loved to hear stories of came here and we believe took the stone.", "So he was bound to it too?" Oliver asked, He wondered if like Tomas his great great uncle had also been someone who was simply alseep in this world. "No", the merfolk seemed deep in thought, "much of what I tell you is based on stories and speculation. It is known that Gregory had on his crew a talented sorcerress, and she was able to learn more of my people's magic than any other human in a long time. You've seen his grotto so you clearly understand that his ships could sail underwater like ours. I believe he was able to avoid bonding with the merstone and instead used it. We know that shortly after the explosion he carried out a series of raids on our city and then all of a sudden he was gone, his ship hasn't been seen above or below the sea in nearly a hundred years. What I now believe is that he was able to take the stone and use it to travel to your world in a more permanent way. I belive this is the same stone that you found in your world and bonded to, and I suspect based on what you've told me the same stone that Tomas touched some 40 years after waking up in a strange world only to find the effects of doing so were not as he intended." Oliver sat and listened in disbelief, he couldn't wrap his head around it the idea of Tomas who he'd seen only a few days before in his world, dieing here a hundred years ago, and then the same stone being brought by Gregory between the worlds decades before Tomas actually woke up in Oliver's world.
As Oliver puzzeled the merfolk stood and looked at the trees and the water. "We must be heading for the water, it will be light soon!" With that he started to walk and motioned for Oliver to follow him. They took a fairly direct path to the water, cutting through a few farms along the way. With his height and long strides the merfolk was able to move quickly and Oliver often struggled to keep up. Finally they reached a small beach in a rocky cove, Oliver could see the sun starting to raise as they crossed the pebbly sand. "I cannot be out during the day" The merfolk said with a hurried tone, he waved his hand at Oliver and suddenly Oliver's vision turned a blue tint, he felt little pinpricks all up and down his legs and looking down he noticed a blue like tint over all his body. "Protective enchantment" The merfolk's voice was muffled, "hold on tight" he said grasphing Oliver's hand he dove into the water and pulled Oliver with him. Underwater a series of fins seemed to unfold along the merfolks back and sides, these gave a fluttering twist and with a slight kick of his feet they were flying through the water at a speed that Oliver didn't think possible. He had instinctively held his breath when they'd first dived under but now flying through the water he opened his mouth with shock and found that he could breath normally, what's more he didn't even seem to be getting wet. Oliver held on tight and watched as the underwater landscape zoomed past him.

#Chapter 26. Return To The Grotto
Oliver flinched as the merfolk turned at breakneck speed towards a wall barely making it through an opening between 2 rocks. Then all of a sudden the space around them opened up and they stopped. Turning to him the merfolk gestured up, "Wait here, rest, you'll be safe and I will return at night so that we may plan our next move.", Oliver looked up but couldn't make out much above the water, letting go of the merfolks hand and kicking he surfaced and through the blue tint in his vision saw he was back in Gregory's pirate cave. The signs of the fighting remained, although there were no dead pirates or merfolk almost as though someone had cleaned up. He swam to the shore and pulled himself up on the bank as he did so the blue tint of his vision fell and he felt the enchantment let go of his body. Turning he was the shape of the merfolk underwater, retreat back to the cave mouth and dissapear. Oliver realized that without the enchantment or a boat he was stuck here, wanting to make the most of it he headed for the entrance to the secret room, he found it open and nervously entered and climbed the stairs. Above the room was empty but had clearly been ransacked since he'd last been there. Looking where he'd laid out the papers explaining how to make a ship sail underwater he found them gone, and just as disheartening so was his bag with his book on Merfolk and the pages torn from the book about traveling between worlds. Exhausted from the day and night Oliver found a corner that seemed safe, curled up and fell quickly asleep.
Oliver awoke to a rough shake and looked up to see the merfolk towering over him. "It is night." the merfolk said in the same horse whisper. "I need you to take me to the shadow lands" Oliver said at once, "some of the pirates managed to get out, and maybe my friend's did too, I have to go find them and let them know I'm alive", the merfolk had an odd look on it's face that Oliver couldn't read but simply replied "No.", "What do you mean no", Oliver was indignant, "you told me you'd help me when you gave me that rock back by the campfire, and so far you haven't helped whenever I needed you!", "You'll remember I did save you from that shagot" he said matter-of-factly, Oliver hadn't heard of a shagot but he thought that it must be the merfolk's name for the shadow cat. "What did Gregory tell you of our world?" the merfolked asked with a quizative tone. "Nothing", Oliver'ss reply was sheepish, "He died before I was born, and I only just found out he was from here, and read the stories he used to tell about being a pirate." "Ah, so like little Tomas Ruiz you find yourself with a head full of pirate stories suddenly thrust into a strange world, and made a central point in a conflict that you know nothing about." the merfolk seemed almost sad as he said it, "I'll tell you more of this world so that you'll understand why I can't help you travel to the shadow lands to find your friends." With that the merfolk sat, Oliver shifted and got comfortable and the story began.
"The Island of Alland was once an active volcano from deep within the world magic, the kind that powers many of our enchantments rose to the surface. It was strictly forbidden for any to settle here as it belonged to all people both above and below the sea. By day the humans would visit it's shores collecting flowers and rocks that they could enchant things with. By night the merfolk did the same. But one day a human got greedy and decided to venture further inland, to reach the ednge of the volcano and from there to draw a greater power from deep within the earth. The jungle on the island was trecherous as it was filled with plants and animals that had been imbued with natural enchantments that flowed through the soil and the water. But this man was a powerful sorcerer and he was able to reach the edge of the volcano, here he was able to build a fortress which went deep underground into the heart of the mountain. He channeled the magic up and through him making him the most powerful person in the world. However magic is not all good, and as he funneled the raw enchantments through him little bits of darkness stayed behind and slowly corrupted the man, making him powerful but evil. The merfolk sensed what was happening and rallied together all the clans in the southern and northern seas. We would unite and destroy the fortress and free the sorcerer who had been traped by his own lust for power. The sorcerer knew of these plans so he gathered together all the humans and turned them against the merfolk, for until then we had been allies. We launched the attack and a feirce battle raged on however the merfolk seemed to have the upper hand. Then in an attempt to turn the tide the sorcerer summoned all the power from deep in the earth and tried to turn it on his attackers, but alas it was too much. The volcano exploded and shattered the island, darkened the sky and left Alland much the way it is today. It took a generation for the smoke to clearn and for human's and merfolk to return to Alland. When they did so they found an island just as magical as ever. Feeling the danger had passed the humans saw the shallow protected bay and decided to settle the island again. The Merfolk knew differently, we implored the humans not to settle on the land but in the end we could not. They built a city in the bay and declared that the island was there's but that we may visit it during the night, and so visit it we did. Our most powerful sorcerers were went into the hills to establish a boundry, around the bay there would be no magic, but beyond it would flow freely. Then we constructed a chain, and enchanted it stopping any human ships from leaving the bay. Trapt and unable to fight us below the sea humans fractured and built their cities where it was safe along the bay, avoiding the forest as we had intended."
"I don't understand", Oliver said, "what was wrong with the island?", "The sorcerer, the one who blew up the land, his body died in the explosion but not his spirit. That was turned dark and cast a shadow of the land that still lives there to this day.", "The shadow?" Oliver asked, "Yes, and it's a renewed war between the shadow and the merfolk that our people fear most, it is this war that many feel is on the precipice, and that the merstone you found was forged to fight against." "But how could travling between worlds help?", the merfolk looked down and said, "I do not know, I suspect that there is some source of power in your world that could be channeled back to this world and give us a chance to defeat the shadow." "Then why the attack on Andmore, why the attack on Orless, why not just come to me and ask for help?" Oliver thought of the burning city of Andmore, and the flooded city of Orless, he thought about the fighting in the cave below and his Sofia and Matias and Nicolas. "There are those of us," the merfolk began, "Those of use, who believe we should strike pre-emptively. Who think that humans will turn to the shadow again when the war begins, and that we are destined to fight them. They wonder why not fight now when the human's don't expect a strike, and when they are not unified. Like I said back at the farm, travel between the worlds leaves a mark, one we can feel, and we felt your arrival here quite strongly. It pushed to action those who felt this was a sign, it was time to attack, to finally wipe out the humans before they could stand against us." "So they they didn't even want to capture me?" Oliver asked dumbfounded. "Of course they said that was the goal, but it was never the real motive. Remember to them you're little more than superstition, no one really knows what the purpose of the travel stone was. For them the answer is not to try to capture some human who may help to turn the tide of the battle, but to wipe out the enemy's forces before the battle even begins.", "I still don't get it," Oliver said, his thoughts still on his friends who had fought for him, "Why can't you take me down the tunnel and to the shadow lands?", "I've told you we are at war with the shadow, and it is forbidden to do this.", "But you could right?" Oliver asked the question expecting he already knew the answer. "Yes" the reply from the merfolk was downtrodden as though he was reluctant to offer the confirmation.
Back in the cave Oliver and the merfolk approached the water the merfolk turned and prepared to wave his hand before the enchantment could enclose him Oliver asked, "Why are you helping me?" the merfolk lowered his hand and gave something that resembled a smile, "I was wondering when you would ask?, My name is Osto of The Southern Deep, but if I were amongst others of my kind they were called me 'Prince Osto'", "Your father is the Merking?" Oliver asked remembering the name Nicolas had given to the head of the merfolk who the pirate king had once fought with. "No, my brother Eeli, although we don't call him 'Merking'. Tell me do you know anything of merfolk politics?", "Only that I can't understand them." Oliver replied. "They're not so different than the politics above land really. You see before we trapped the humans on Alland we were many clans spread over the ocean. It was my clan that lead the effort to trap the humans, and to build our city beneath the southern sea, just past the narrows where our great merstone forges lie. And so my people have ruled the merfolk as best we can, but we're still a fractious people, most merfolk roam the ocean alone, hunting fish and never stepping foot on land. I told you that some people believe we should wipe out humans, one of them is my brother - not the king - another brother, I have quite a few brothers and sisters. He may lay a claim to the throne if he so wishes, but to do so succesffully he would need support of the heads of the clans. By giving in to these zealots and attacking the human cities the king prevents this support from forming and keeps his throne.", "But then why help me?" Oliver asked and then a thought popped into his head, "You want the throne don't you? You think that I can support your claim.", again an Osto gave something resembling a smile, "I will not lie the thought has crossed my mind, but that is not why I started helping you. You see it was on my advice that the king made a deal with these hardline factions in the first place. Their support has been forming for a while and I courted them for him, conviced them to bide their time and form an alliance, have the king owe them a favor. Then of course when you arrived they came calling and it was as simple demand, return the favor or lose power, it seemed such an easy decision at the time..." Osto trailed off for a minute, "I saw the destruction at Andmore first hand, and Orless as well, I made a mistake and meeting you has confirmed that. There may be a war between the shadow and the merfolk building but humans will stand against the shadow this time.", "How do you know?" Oliver asked, "Because you will lead them!" the comment took Oliver off guard as Osto waved his hand placing the protective enchantment on Oliver and pulled him into the water. He quickly turned towards the tunnel parting the luminescent kelp as he accelerated and swam into the darkness.

#Chapter 27. The River
With the speed at which he swam Oliver and Osto quickly passed through the tunnel and Oliver could now just make out dark sky above the water's surface. Osto lead on as the water grew shallower and shallower until he let go of Oliver's hand, lept from the water and did not return. Oliver placed his feetdown realizing he could stand and popped his head above the water. They were at a small sandbar in the middle of river, all around them were the dense forrest of the shadow lands. Walking ashore Oliver felt the enchantment drop again. "If you wish to remain in the shadow lands I must leave you here." Osto said, "Where are you going?" Oliver asked, "I'll follow this river to the northern sea." Osto said jesturing to the river, "but don't worry I won't abandon you, come to the shore and use this and I'll be there to help" he again produced the white stone that he'd given Oliver before on the road. Oliver pocketed it and thanked Osto for his help watching him dive into the river and dissaper beneath the dark river.
Looking around Oliver decided that the best bet would be to stay on this little sandbar until morning, the rocky sand at the top seemed dry probably deposited from high water levels and above water most days. Sitting here he tried to rest but found he wasn't tiered he looked around and listened to the trees and the birds. Looking across the river he was pairs of glowing eyes, but the water was to wide and too fast moving for anyone to attack him so they just dissapeared back into the trees. The sandbar he was sitting on was formed by the intersection of two rivers, the large one that Osto and he had come through ran deep into the forest and out of sight, back Oliver imagined to a cliff face where it dissapeared into the rock. Another smaller river joined it here, depositing the sediment that formed this sandbar. That river also seemed to wind back into the forest, Oliver imagined it going back to a water fall or something. If his friends had made it out of the cave alive they would have reached this point easily, but then would they have continued out to the northern sea like Osto had done, or would they stay in the shadow lands? Nicolas's men knew how to survive here, they'd done so before, but they'd mostly stayed on their boat at night. But now with just small boats would they be so bold as to try to stay out at sea or would they find a way to spend a night in the forest?
As the sun rose Oliver vowed to explore up the other stream aways to see what he could find, he wished he had the staff the Lucas had given him. The same one that had never lead him astray before, he also wished he had the illusive cloak so that he could move without being seen, but he knew that he had to accept what he did have, so he clutched the white stone in his pocke and said "Thankyou".
The river was shallow enough to cross on foot and he began his trek up-river staying along one side of the bank. Farily quickly the land started to slope up an the river reduced in size to a large stream. It started to became more and more rocky. Rather than keep pushing along in the dense woods to the side of the stream Oliver decided that it was easy enough now to walk in the water, being careful with each step. As he kept climbing he thought he heard a distant roaring sound, probably a water fall he told himeself remembering how he'd invisioned the river the night before. Finally coming around a bend he saw it. A black tower not large like the one where he'd found Valeria but still at least a few stories tall, at it's base a water wheel was turned in a small pool that accumulated at the base of a huge water fall. The tower was built right along the side of a black rock cliff that dwarfed it the back rocks of the tower and the back cliff behind it made the tower almost dissapear. From the roof of the tower Oliver could see a small stream of smoke. Apprehensive but hopeful to find his friend Oliver rushed the last of the way to the tower almost slipping on the wet stones. The entrance was right up against the side of the cliff, Oliver had to circle the tower to find it from the entrance a path lead up a steep hill and Oliver assumed up to the top of the cliff if he followed it. Disinterested in that so much as who may be in the tower he quickly climbed the 2 steps to the door opened it and looked inside.
The ground floor of the tower was a large open room, the ceiling was tall and vaulted, made from the same black stones. The primary feature of the room was an oversized fireplace where embers still burned but the fire had almost died out. Oliver imagined that if it was fully stocked this room would be almost impossibly hot. The water wheel outside connected here to a bellows that was stoking the fire, keeping it burning. In the middle of the room stood a large table, with chairs that had been pushed aside as though many people had left in a hurry. At the back of the room a staircase lead up. Oliver crossed and climbed the stairs. The foor above was clearly a sorcerers labratory. An oven was built into one wall drawing the heat from the furnace below. The rest of the space were the tell-tale tables with glass and fireboxes that Oliver had seen at the guild hall. Again the room was empty but showed signs of recent use. Then Oliver saw it, sitting on a table in the middle of the room, his pack.
Oliver opened the pack and looked inside, it was mostly empty, the book on Merfolk artifacts was gone, but the papers he'd taken that explained traveling between worlds were still there. When he'd found the secret room in the cave ransacked he'd assumed the merfolk who had attacked had done it. Taking his bag in the process, but Osto had said that the merfolk don't go out to the shadow lands, why would they bring his bag here, take a book about themselves from it, light a fire and leave the bag? It didn't make sense, the only explaination was that it wasn't the merfolk, it was the pirates who had gone back, but only Sofia and he had found the secret room, that must mean that Sofia was alive. Oliver imagined that after the explosion Matias must have gotten her to a boat and then they probably washed up on that same sandbar. Sofia was unconsious but when she came to she probably had them go back to find Oliver and when they couldn't find him got the things from the secret room instead. But what about this tower, why would they have come here and what was it for? Whatever the reason Oliver realizing his friends had since moved on he decided to do the same. There was still some daylight out and he hoped that by going quickly he could catch his friends.
Grabbing his bag and heading out of the tower Oliver made his way up the path and started to climb to the higher elevation, under the cover of the forest the path became dark quickly but he stopped for a minute to let his eyes adjust and then continued on. On the way he passed a Sun Lily bush and tore off a vine, he wasn't sure if he'd run into shadow cats here but he wanted to be prepared if he did. The trail turned once back on itself and then climbing higher deposited Oliver on an exposed expanse of rock, to one side forest, the other a shear drop off. Looking over the edge he was able to see the roof of the tower he had left, the waterfall that fed the stream started just in front of him as a steady flow of water that made it's way back into the forest. Looking out from the ledge Oliver was able to see where the stream he'd followed this morning cut through the forest joined the bigger river and then flowed out to northern sea. He thought about Osto who had traveled out there and wondered what he was doing right now.
Looking around the ledge Oliver didn't see any paths other than the one he'd come from, the trail was clearly well traveled but from here he wasn't sure where to head next. He sat for a minute staring out at the northern sea and wondered about his next move. He thought about his friends hiking up here and wondered what they would do, then it dawned on him. They wouldn't have come this way. They were clearly at the tower but he knew they had boats, they could easily travel back through the cave out to the bay, or down the river to the Northern Sea and then look for another entrance, why would they risk the Shadow Lands? As he looked out at the northern sea he imagined he saw the shape of a small boat almost out on the horizon and resolved that he'd need to go back to the shore and find Osto to get back to his friends.

#Chapter 28. The Forge
The walk down the trail to the tower was uneventful even as the sun had begun to set and it had grown dark in the forest. Oliver had gathered some berries like Valeria had taught him. Inside the ground floor of the tower the fire was just embers but he found a stack of wood and carefully fed it first with small sticks, then larger, and larger peices of wood until it was burning so hot he started to get uncomfortable. Sitting at the table he ate the food he had and then thought about where to sleep. Even with the door locked upstairs seemed safer so he added a few more logs to the fire and climbed the stairs.
Upstairs Oliver looked for a place to sleep comfortably as he did so he noticed a bookshelf that he hadn't paid attention to before. Inside the books still seemed to be in reasonable shape, Oliver remembered the desk back in the cave and thought about what Sofia had said about the skill that it was enchanted with. He thought about what Osto had told him about Gregory traveling with a sorceress who was immensely skilled. Osto had said that the Merfolk had pushed back anything magical out of the human lands on the inside of the island. Could it be that this was Gregory's true secret, a passage between the bay and a place where his sorceress could work away from the eyes of the guild and closer to the source of the enchantments they practiced. Opening the door on the shelf he could tell from the dust that the empty spots had once contained books but they had since been taken, probably Sofia. Oliver imagined her seeing this and being filled with wonder at the information inside, poor Dimitri and Angelo assuming they survived the cave they're probably rowing a boat full of books all around Alland. Oliver pulled a few books from the shelves glancing at the first few pages and returning them. Most of the books had dry names like "Herbs and usages" many of them were written by someone named Delfina López. Finally Lucas pulled a book off the top shelf and opening the first page saw "A study of the Travel Stone by Delfina López" beneath the title was an illustration of the merstone that Oliver had found that fateful day at the beach, sitting down he began to read.

```
The travel stone is unlike other merstone in that while it may appear like a merstone on the outside it was not forged by the merfolks' master artificers at the southern forge. Merfolk legend says that the stone was built for the war to come between the shadow and the Merfolk but a close examination of the stone itself as well as it's history in merfolk legend seem to suggest it may be much older. I believe that the stone itself may have predated the first war and could have been forged on the volcano at the heart of Alland. The Merfolk legends have always treated humans at the ones who broke the rules and tried the tap the power of Alland's volcano directly, but the existence of the travel stone suggests that humans were not alone in this endevour. We have taken liberties raiding the southern kingdoms libraries to try to obtain more information, but Merfolk were a nomadic people before they unified during the war. Most recorded history begins with recounts of the founding of the city of Inbrov. The oldest mention we've found the the travel stone seems to suggest it was already lost by the time the city was founded. Again I believe that the best explaination is that it was lost with the explosion of Alland.
The story of Tomas finding the travel stone is an interesting one, Gregory had already begun looking for it and peicing together evidence of it's whereabouts before the explosion that killed the boy and his family. Some 5 years before the explosion a small underwater earthquake occured near the center of the bay, Gregory had a theory that if the Travel stone had been burried this earthquake could have unearthed it, he'd spent the better part of a year before the explosion tracing tides and currentes and working to figure out where a stone could have reached. He felt for sure that it would wash to the Orless side of the bay and not the Andmore side but his work had otherwise proved fruitless. We found out about the explosion some 2 days after it happened by chance, a merchant freighter was sailing by and we had stopped them to see if they were interested in trade. Over a drink the captain told the story about how people from the farms had been worried after an explosion seemingly from no-where had blown up a farm. They had asked the sorcerers guild for help and, of course, been rebuffed. I'm glad I left that god forsaken place and it's stupid politics behind. It was easy enough to find the farm and by looking for hotspots of enchantment I was able to find the Travel stone. We could not tell from appearences if this was simply a merstone or this legendary artifact, but our hope led us to take the utmost caution until we could get the stone back to the ship and into a lab.
Even from it's inital discovery in the wreckage of the farm I've been concerned about the Merfolk realizing we have the stone. It had been 3 or 4 days since the explosion by the time we got there and the enchantment's residue was still strong. Merfolk who are attuned to enchantments could likely sense this and find it easily however I hope that whatever they sensed they didn't realize what exactly they were dealing with. Still the safest place to study the stone will be in the lab in the shadow lands. There will be modification nessesary to keep it safe but the latent enchantments in the shadow lands will mask any work I'm doing.

We've tried the stone and it works. When you touch the stone it bonds to you then when you fall asleep your spirit travels between the worlds and manifests in a physical form elsewhere. Gregory tried it to travel to the world, to a place called New York, I was able to break the binding on the stone here without damaging it and he woke up. We're not sure how the sleeping portion of it works still and will require more experiements, but I know that time works in odd ways between our worlds. Gregory described spending hours in that world marveling at it's machines and colorful cities but here he was only asleep for a few minutes before I broke the bond.

We've figured out the activation mechanism, sleeping is by far the easiest way to activate it but by simply relaxing and clearing your mind in an almost medidative state you can activate the travel. As I understand it your mind is traveling and must first relax it's hold on this world to travel to the other. Gregory is becoming increasingly enamored with the world he's traveling to he now seeks to spend days there at a time. However I have noticed that by breaking the bond to bring him back to this world the travel stone is starting to fracture internally. I'll need a better way to return him to our world.

I've been studying the enchantment at the core of the stone, it's incredibly complex and I can't begin to understand it all but I've found what appear to be a few flaws. One of them I can reverse enginer a potion to interact with and it will return the spirit back to it's world. The only trouble is that this potion must be created in the world in which it is used and Gregory lacks the skill to do so and hasn't seen any of the ingredients for magic in that world that he would need even if he had the skill. Gregory is getting impatient and wishes to return to that world but I fear that if he were to do so again I would not be able to return him here without destroying the travel stone.

A page was torn out of the book, Oliver wondered what it would have held. He had a feeling that the potion that Lucas had given him had been this same potion that Delfina described. Was it possible that Lucas had found this tower when he was in the shadow lands and learned these same secrets?

As I'm writing this Gregory is still recovering. I found him last night asleep with the travel stone in his hand, I had feared something like this would happen and his desire to travel between the worlds would get the better of him. I had to work through the night but I found a way to bring him back without severing the bond to the travel stone. It seems to have some side effects, his memory of his time in the other world is hazy, almost like a dream, and he's sore all over. I'm not sure how long he was in the other world but I believe it was several years before I pulled him out. I must spend the rest of the day working on a more permanent solution or break the bond on the stone again and risk destroying it.

Today marks the first day in many that feels like a success. A potion I've been able to create when it's taken before sleeping limits the time in the other world. Gregory has agreed to take strong doses of this, over the last few nights he's spent nearly a whole lifetime in that world and while the weariness doesn't show on his body it's aparent that it's worn on his mind. He's tasked me with a new avenue of study. He wishes to travel to this world in body, his hope is that he can bring the travel stone with him returning to Alland as he pleases. I now have a deep understanding of the enchantment enclosed in the stone and I believe I can do what he asks but again it will require modifications to this lab and the installation of a proper enchantment forge.

There are weakpoints between the worlds, a sufficiently powerful enchantment triggered at one of these points could be used to travel between the worlds, I'm sure of this. However I have yet to discover the enchantment that could allow the traveling or where these weakpoints even are.

It's obvious to me having further studied the enchantment that these weakpoints are the source of the magic in our world. It look some digging through the layers of enchantment on the stone but atlast at the very center of it all is the telltale signs. It is almost certainly confirmation that this stone was forged in the fire of Alland now that I know this. We still need to find the enchantment but we know that if we can get to the forge at Inbrov we should be able to make the journey. It will be risky, the enchantment I'm working off of only carries the mind, to expand seems possible but there are so many intriciate layers that changing something so fundamental could have large ripple effects.

I've had to break the news to Gregory that he will have to unbond from the travel stone and may never again bond to it. I know in theory what needs to be done to travel between the worlds but the stone is the key. Without it the travel cannot work. I've given Gregory a weak dose of the potion to return him here so he may spend a long time in that world. I just hope when he wakes up and we unbond the stone it deosn't fracture.

The stone did not fracture and we're ready to go. I've prepared a large potion and parts of the Scimitar have been re-inscribed and re-planked to allow the conduction of the enchantment. This is highly untested and there are many things that could go wrong. I'm not entirely sure if the careful balance between allowing the ship both to sail underwater so that it could reach Inbrov and allowing the ship to travel between worlds can hold long enough. If we're intercepted by Merfolk we may find that we all drown before we can make the journey. Gregory doesn't seem put off by this, the Scimitar can be run by a skeleton crew and that's all we have at this point. Many of the other men were sent off with payment that I'd carefully enchanted so they forget just enough of their exploits to keep us safe, still it's risky but that's what being a pirate is sometimes. The men who have stayed have been put hard at work preparing for what we'll find on the otherside. Gregory has said that gold is highly prized in this other world and so the forge has been burning non-stop transmuting stones into this worthless metal. Meanwhile I've been focused on a more relevent treasure, chests full of enchanting powders, from what Gregory has told me there is no magic in that world, so I want enough raw materials to craft the potions we need while we're there and for a return trip. If we do fail I've included a full set of instructions on the enchantment, hopefully someone else can find the travel stone and continue the work I've started.
```

The next few pages contained detailed diagrams and instructions for mixing poitions full of terms and ingrediats that Oliver had never heard of. There were drawings of a teardrop shaped boat from various angles with lines and glyphs drawn on them illustrating the correct way to channel the enchantment. Then after all the drawings a page with the neat scrawl replaced by a messy hand.

```
Know that we've succeeded but the Scimitar was lost. Gregory could not understand the nature of time and the stone and found himself trapped without the wonders he'd dreamt, and yet my suffering was worse. For I was cursed to be without those that I love the most, the enchantments that I've crafted for all my life. I find myself in that world in a silver cage, wealthy beyond measure but powerless. I return now the only way I may by binding myself to the stone. Studies here will bear no more fruit, to long from this place the stone has been absent, and with my body trapt in that god-forsaken place I'm powerless here. I must return to the guild, they alone may help me to find a way to craft a new stone, and escape the cruel punishment I've been consiged to.
```

Oliver flipped through the remaining empty pages and then closed the book. He imagined Delfina in his world with Gregory, transported back here and going to the sorcerers guild like he had done. They seemed receptive to him, but would she have been so lucky? He was tired and it was late so he curled up on the warm floor and fell fast alseep. As his eyes closed Lucas tried to imagine what Delfina had said about letting go of this world in order to ease the transition he imagined his mind leaping out of his body and drifting up into the sky until it became black and then.

#Chapter 29. A Brief Return
Oliver awoke in a cold sweat, he was in Steven's room where they had fallen asleep. Reaching into his pocket he felt the travel stone was still there and then felt nausous and dizzy and fell over everything going to black.

#Chapter 30. To The Northern Sea
Oliver woke up on the floor of the tower, light had just started to come in from the windows, it was early morning. He wasn't sure the minutes in Steven's room were a dream or... was it possible... He took a breath and then sat up. Sitting calmly he inhaled and exhaled deep breaths closed his eyes and imagined his mind leaping out of his body and drifting up into the sky it got black and then... nothing. Oliver opened his eyes, he was still sitting in the tower. It must have just been a dream. Standing and grabbing his pack he reached into the pocket and felt the small white stone that Osto had given him. He knew that today he'd have to make it to the shore by nightfall, Osto could protect him once he met him there. Oliver looked out the windows of the tower and thought about how he'd make it to the coast. The stream he'd followed here wandered it's way down hill until it joined the larger river and then made a relatively straight line out to the sea. He could see from the tower a small cove, a direct line straight from the tower there would be significantly shorter, but he thought about how densly wooded the forest could be. He was sure the stream would be safer.
Oliver began to make his way downstream being careful to stay on dry rocks and not step into fast moving water. After the last 2 days having no run-ins with shadow cats or other dangers he let his guard drop a little and made good time getting towards the sandbar until the stream began to widen and join the river. Here he could no longer walk along the rocks exposed out of the stream, he headed off to the side of the stream that would put him downstream of the sandbar ahead of him. Along the side of the river the forest was thicker and he had to slow his pace pushing through but trying to avoid straying too deep into the woods to lose sight of the water. After a long walk with the river staying mostly level near him he reached a part of the river where rocks formed some foaming rapids. Along the side of the water he was walking he could see that the ground stayed mostly level as the water dropped off down the rapids. Just ahead he could see the river open up into the sea, but if he continued on this bank he could see that he'd end up above a large cliff. He considered the river and thought about what it would take to cross it. The other side of the river was rocky, if he could get to the land beyond he could keep on like he had been picking along the sides but to get there he'd have to swim and he knew that there was no way he'd be able to make it across the rapids. He decided to push ahead, after the first set of rapid there was a shallow section along the side he was walking and from the shallow sloaping ground he could see a narrow path that lead into the forest. Oliver had a good feeling about the path and throwing his earlier caution to the wind turned and headed into the forest.
The trail was well worn with the ground on either side nearly half a foot taller and heavily wooded. The trail was winding but Oliver often checked behind him to ensure that nothing was following him. The trail remained behind him and he imagined that if we wanted to get back to the river he would simply turn around and head back. The trail he was following turned, and opened into a bigger clearing when suddently Oliver stopped. There in the middle of the clearing was a Shadow Cat, dead on the ground, with flies long since having arived on the corpse. From the cat's body a small spear that Oliver recognized as Osto's was still stuck. He thought about the rapids and imagined that Osto must have decided it was better to go on foot for this part. Then on the floor Oliver saw the blood drops, they were dark and dried at this point but continued off down the trail at large intervals as though they were being shed by a tall person. Oliver went to pull the spear from shadow cat and found it was stuck, he carefully put one foot on the cats side and then pulled hard and pushed with his foot, falling backwards the short spear came loose. Collecting himself he quickly got up and followed the blood along the trail, spear in hand.
The trail curved and twisted through trees with the blood drops spaced out at increasing distance as it went. Soon the blood seemed to stop all together, Oliver felt this was probably a good sign. Then all of a sudden the trail opened up to a small cove like the one he'd seen from the tower. There on the rocks were more blood stains, but also perched atop of them, a shadow cat. Oliver took a step back into the trees hoping the cat hadn't noticed him. He dropped his hand reaching into his pocket and touched the stone saying "I'm at the shore I need your help". Then croaching down, he held the short spear he'd taken tightly in both hands. Taking a deep breath he stayed low to the ground, the light was fading and he hoped that Osto would get his message and come quickly to save him. Oliver could hear the waves crash on the rocks, the pounding of his heart, and then what sounded almost like distant thunder behind him as the hairs on the back of his neck pricked up. He turned and saw another Shadow cat leap out of the forest, he quickly flailed with the spear and tried to roll out of the way. The spear struck something and Oliver heard a yelp just before the cat slammed into him and knocked him onto his back. Trying to squirm back Oliver found the spear stuck firmly in the big cat's chest, the impact had turned the tooth first lunge into a headbutt, but one of the elongated sharp teeth had still sliced Oliver on his chest. Worse he felt the sharp pain in his arm as the cat's claw sank into his flesh. Remembering Osto back at the farm house Oliver pushed on the spear and twisted. The spear didn't move much but the cat let out a loud cry and leapt off of Oliver and retreated to the forest, dragging the spear with it. Meanwhile the other cat that had been perched on the rocks had drawn closer. Oliver dropped the bag off his shoulder and quickly pulled ths Sun Lily vine from it. Dragging himself to his feet Oliver tried to swing the Sun Lily vine at the cat. Pain shot through his arm as he tried to move it and he was only able to give a limp swing. Still the cat took a step back recognizing the throny vine. Grabbing the vine in his other hand Oliver was able to make a larger arc, he walked slowly towards the cat swinging the vine in front of him and watched as the cat backed off and tried to circle him. Finally Oliver was between the cat and the water he stepped backwards trying not to lose his footing on rocks and then turned, dropping the vine he did his best to run to the water hoping that the cat wouldn't pursue. He jumped from rock to rock and then was about to jump into the shallow water when pain shot down his back and he was knocked into the water face down. He tried to scream but got a mouthful of water and choked. All of a sudden he felt a tearing on his back, more pain and then he was rolled onto his back and lay partially submerged in the shallow water.
Oliver tried to situp but a firm rough hand held him down. He looked and saw the long boney fingers of a merfolk and followed the long lanky arm up to a slender body. The merfolk was holding him down with one hand and waving the other about as the white lines on the merstone it wore around it's neck glowed. Just behind this merfolk he could just make out 2 more tall lanky forms as they fought the shadow cat back into the forest. As they returned the hand on Oliver's chest lifted and he went to sit up but then was seized by the shoulder from one of the Merfolk who had been fighting and quickly pulled to stand. Oliver was not short but the Merfolk all were at-least 2 feet taller than him so standing in the shallow water this close to them he had to strain his neck to see their faces. He immediately realized that none of them were Osto, Oliver thought about the blood he'd seen, maybe Osto had been hurt and sent these Merfolk to come to his aid? The Merfolk who had originally held him down reached their long fingers into his pocket producing the stone Osto had given him, looked it once over and then threw it out to sea. Not a good sign that these merfolk were with Osto. Oliver remembered something he's seen in a movie and yelled out "I'm under the protection of Prince Osto of the Southern Deep". One of the merfolk who had been fighting came up to him with an awkward smile and said in that characteristic hoarse voice, "Pity, we're under orders from King Eeli to bring you back to Inbrov." "You should listen to him!" Oliver recognized the voice of Osto and as the other merfolk turned he saw him rising up from the water, long spear in hand and large gash across his chest that looked to have mostly healed. "Last time I checked it was your brother that was the king, not you." The merfolk fighter said his voice dripping malace. "Perhaps there is another way, Nooa, right?" Osto said spreading his arms in a peace gesture, "Let us ask the boy what he wishes to do?" Osto nodded to Oliver. Oliver thoughts went straight to his friends, he wanted to get to them but wasn't sure where they were. Then he thought about the mission he'd been sent on by Lucas, and the trek that Sofia and Matias and he had set out on what seemed like forever ago in Orless. "Inbrov is where the merfolk master artificers are right?" Oliver asked, the merfolk who had held him down nodded and gave a quiet "Yes", "Then that's where I want to go" Oliver said. "See," Osto gave a slight smile, "we travel together to Inbrov with the boy under my protection, we all get what we want." there seemed to be murmmuring of agreements, Oliver added quickly "I need my bag" the merfolk Osto had called Nooa nodded yes to this and Oliver headed back to the forest line to get it. As he picked up the bag he looked at where the cuts had been on his chest and arms, they were almost completely healed, just a little red and sore. Some enchantment must have healed him.
Back at the water Osto waved his hand and the protective enchantment enclosed Oliver, then he gestured to the other merfolk as if to say "after you". Nooa looked coldly back at Osto and replied "I'm not supid, you'll go first, we'll follow". "Have it your way" Osto said and quickly pulled Oliver into the water and they sped off. They stayed close along the shore line giving Oliver the terrible feeling like they would slam into a rock at any second, looking behind him he could see the three other Merfolk staying close behind. Just then Osto said in a low voice "You can swim right." Oliver was caught off guard, was it a question, "You can swim?" this time clearly a question Osto was asking him. "Yes" Oliver replied. "Ok, when I say so I want you to swim to shore as fast as you can." Oliver was confused, then looking ahead he saw 3 dark shapes in the water, distant but growing larger. "Now!" Osto said letting go of Oliver's hand Oliver turned to swim to the shore seeing out of the corner of his eye one of the other Merfolk arms out reached to grab him when suddently a black shape slammed into the merfolk and blood filled the water. Oliver swam as hard as he could and didn't stop swimming till he reached the shallow water and ran on shore feeling the protective enchantment fall off of him. Turning back to the water he couldn't see what was going on beneath the dark surface but the thrashing of waves and the occasional fin ripping through the water seemed to indicate some fight. Just then Osto appeared from the water, spear gone and new cuts down his body. He grabbed Oliver's hand and yelled "Run" leading them along the shore until they reached some large rocks. Croaching behind these Osto stopped for a breath.
"What happened?" Oliver was in shock, Osto was breathing heavily and the wounds on his chest seemed to to be bleeding freely. "The shagot, what do you call them?", "Shadow Cats?" Oliver asked, "Yes I suppose that's as good a name as any, well then those would have been Shadow Fish.", Oliver thought about it for a minute, "You knew they would attack us?", "Yes, after I left you I made my way back to the sea, I suspect you saw where I had a run in with a shagot, but then out in the sea I sensed something strange, I followed it here where I found those aweful things." Something wasn't making sense to Oliver, "You mean you didn't know what they were?", he asked. "No, these are something new, something that shadow has corrupted recently. I told you a war was coming and this I think is evidence of that. The Shagots, Shadow Cats, do a good job defending the forest from intruders as you've seen. We merfolk avoid going ashore for this very reason. But these fish...", "They keep you off the cost entirely." Oliver said, "worse" was Osto's only response, "They could attack your city?" Oliver asked it as a question but knew the anser, Osto shook his head yes to affirm it. "But there was only 3?" Oliver realized how stupid the question was as he asked it, "They have a spawning pool just inland a bit. I was able to find it last night, come I'll show you." Osto stood and started to walk, Oliver quickly joined him.

#Chapter 31. The Spawing Pool
Osto led Oliver further along the shore until they reached a shallow stream. Following it inland they pushed through thick forest until they reached a large clearing bordered on the back by a cliff face of smooth black rock. In the clearing up against the cliff was a wide circular pool. Oliver could just make out shapes beneath the water. "I don't know how many of these pools there are, but in this pool alone there must be hundreds of these monsters." Osto said. "I told you before that we merfolk were largely nomatic, scattered across the seas, Inbrov is a city of only a thousand people, if our soliders were off, say attacking humans, then we'd be powerless to stop these monsters from wiping out our city." "What can we do?" Oliver asked, "Nothing, for now" Osto replied, "I must return to Inbrov and tell the King of what I've seen in private, if the warmongers amongst our clan leaders find out about this then they will want to launch an attack." he paused for a minute, "they may not be wrong, but I worry that the collateral damage they'll leave in their wake will destroy more innocent lives.", "I want to go with you to Inbrov." Oliver said as Osto turned to head back to the shore. "No, it's too risky right now for you to come back. My brother's men being the ones sent to bring you in prove that. You must make your way out of the shadow lands on foot." Osto pointed to the cliff face, "Just up there and over the next ridge and you'll be back in Andmore." Oliver thought about Lucas and his ability to create the potion to bring him back to his world. Maybe going back to Andmore wasn't such a bad thing after all.
Osto left for the shore, Oliver turned and walked into the clearing staying as far from the side of the pool as he could. He reached the cliff face and pressed his hands against it. It was smooth and cold, impossible to climb, he knew that he'd have to follow it into the forest and hope to find a place where he could get on top of it but as exposed as he felt in the clearing he didn't want to risk the forest at night. He sat down back to the cliff and relaxed. It was night and he should sleep but all the excitment with the shadow cats and the merfolk and the shadow fish, it was all too much, so he tried to relax and just looked out on the clearing. There across from him, near where he and Osto had entered he saw a small bush with red berries growing on it. He recognized them as some of the berries that Valeria had told him was ok to eat, he wasn't terribly hungry but he knew he'd need strength tomorrow so getting up he walked over and picked some berries eating them as he returned to the cliff wall. He glanced around before sitting and then saw it. Across the pool from him and just making it's way out of the forest were 3 shadow cats. Oliver knew they could jump far but he was pretty sure there here at nearly it's widest point the pool was too big for the shadow cats to leap. As he watched they neared the edge keeping their eyes fixed on him. He thought about his encouter earlier in the day and glanced all around to see if any were trying to sneak up on him. It seemed like it was just these three cats, eyeing him from across the pool.P ressing his back against the wall Oliver started to slowly inch his way along towards the forest, as he did so one of the cats broke off from the others and headed for a narrower part of the pool, where the cat could easily make the jump across. Oliver froze, he thought about making a break for the forest, then imagined a shadow cat just beyond the tree. Nervously Oliver pressed his back into the wall heart beat loudly. The cat had now made it to the narrow opening of the pool, it casually lept across and was on the bank with Oliver. Looking to his right Olivier saw that where there had been two cats one now stood. Frantically looking around Oliver spotted the third cat, it had climbed it's way to the top of the cliff and was now pacing along getting ready to drop down on Oliver when the moment seemed right. Surrounded from around and above Oliver was desperate for an escape, he looked around and saw the tree line, a few feet away, if he ran - but just then the cat that had crossed over to his side of the bank croached for a leap. Without thining Oliver dove off to his right and into the pool.
The water in the pool was a cold shock to Oliver, he went to kick and swim to the surface for air but before he could he was slammed into by the huge school of shadow fish. The fish were swiming in a tight group following some pattern and Oliver was caught in the crush and dragged along. Suddenly the fish made a hard turn and Oliver was able to escape, kicking and pulling he surfaced and found himself in complete darkness. Floating Oliver wanted nothing more than to get out of the water, he wasn't sure why the Shadow Fish hadn't hurt him but he didn't want to stick around and find out if they would. Swimming randomly in a direction that he was pretty sure he hadn't come from Oliver bumped into a stone wall, grabbing onto the side he was able to pull himself up onto a small stone ledge. He was in a cave, the entrance to which must be underwater in the spawning pool. Getting his bearings he was able to stand on the narrow ledge and pick a direction that he was pretty sure he had come from and worked his way ahead slowly avoiding the water to his left and kept walking through the darkness for what felt like hours. Atlast the cave started to narrow and up-ahead there was light, he wondered if he'd find himself in another tower. His left foot stepped down expecting to find the cave floor but dipped a few inches lower and splashed in the water, almost instictively Oliver lifted it up but when he didn't hear any thrashing realized that the water here had become too shallow for the Shadow Fish. Continueing along in the water now the cave kept narrowing until he had to crawl and pull himself through the opening. At last he emerged, not in a tower but in a small forest. He felt a shiver run down his body and then a feeling like a weight lifting.
It wasn't quite daylight, but the sun had risen and Oliver could see well enough now. Here the stream kept running downhill through the trees. Turning around to look he saw a small black cliff behind where the stream existed the cave. The ridgeline above was lined with a dense forest. Turning back to the forest he headed out following the stream. The stream started to widen and became larger and larger as he walked the trees here were tall but loosely spaced allowing lots of light between them. The sun was just starting to really rise when he heard a stern voice "Stop right there!", Oliver looked around confused and then spotted behind him a man wearing the red tunic and uniform of the Andmore guard, his sword was drawn. Stopping in his tracks Oliver raised his arms and opened his hands to show he had no weapons. "What are you doing in the kings wood?" the man asked. Oliver just hoped that his name wasn't being widely cursed in Andmore and said "I'm Oliver and I'm here to see Lucas Álvarez!". "Hmm", the guard grunted and then said "I'm taking you to Lucas alright, we'll see what he wants to do with you." with that he walked over and grabbed Oliver's hand and pulled him rather more forcibly then he needed to over nearby ridge and revealed a large waggon drawn by a team of horses and accompanied my many men with axes and saws.

#Chapter 32. The Logging Camp
Oliver rode on the waggon as it wound it's way through a well worn trail finally reaching the cliff face. Here in the shadow of the cliffs a series of tents had been setup. Guards stood around eating food from a small pot that was cooking over a fire. "Where's Lucas?" the guard who had aprehended Oliver asked. "Already up" was the reply, the man had gestured and when Oliver looked he saw a series of wooden ladders that scaled the small cliff. The waggon unloaded and many of the men headed for the camp to get some food, Oliver was pushed by the guard to a ladder and told "climb". The cliff here wasn't very tall but still the ladder seemed very makeshift and creaked as Oliver climbed it finally coming out at the top of the ledge. From here he could see over the forest behind him and out to the shallow bay. They were in a forest that was behind Andmore city proper. The kings wood is what the guard had called it. Looking around on the ridge Oliver could tell from the telltale narled trees that this was the shadow lands. Another guard was waiting at the top of the ladder and not realizing that Oliver was a prison said "They're starting work over there" pointing to a spot in the trees. Oliver looked down and saw that the man who had been guarding him was just starting up the ladder. Best if I go see Lucas by myself he thought and then headed off.
Oliver found Lucas just inside the forest moving about between trees manically. Oliver noticed some of the trees had small red strings tied around them. Lucas hadn't noticed Oliver yet and Oliver was about to call out when he heard a familiar voice "Oliver!" Oliver turned and there coming out of the forest was Sofia. She ran up to Oliver and gave him a big hug. "We went back to the cave and couldn't find you! We thought the merfolk must have captured you." On his shoulder Oliver felt a hand rest, "It's good to see you alive." Lucas had come up behind him. "What are you doing here" Oliver asked looking around. "Are you done with your trees?" Lucas asked looking at Sofia who nodded back, "Then I suggest we continue this reunionion down at the camp." with that Lucas lead the way back through the trees and out to the ledge. To Oliver's amusement the guard had finally made his way up the ladder and when he saw Oliver, Lucas, and Sofia walking calmly together out of the woods he quickly stood straight at attention and had the good sense not to say anything.
Sitting back in front of a tent and eating some real food for the first time since he was on the Shadow Run Oliver bubbled with questions for Sofia. "I saw you knocked out by the explosion, but you must have made it out of the cave?", "Yes," Sofia said, "but more importantly how did you make it out of the cave, we left you without a boat and that place was crawling with Merfolk." Oliver explained how he had woken up in the storeroom in Orless and then turning to Lucas said. "I had to give them your diary" and then try as he may to forgot "Also they burned Carlos' farm, I'm not sure if he made it out", Lucas seemed visibly upset and shook his head as if in disbelief. Changing the subject Oliver turned to Sofia, "Did Nicolas and Matias?", "Yeah they made it, they're both back at the city getting ready." "Getting ready for what" Oliver asked, "Well... wait a second, you found the tower too!" Sofia had just noticed Oliver's bag. At the words the tower Lucas' head perked up. Glaring at Sofia Lucas said "You were in Delfina's tower!" taken off guard Sofia got defensive, "I don't know, it was just a tower we found, why does it matter whose it is?" Oliver could see tears starting to form in Lucas' eyes but the old sorcerer yelled through them, "It matters greatly that you were in the tower of Delfina López, the shadow is strong there and you risked being tainted, you come to me with some genious idea and don't tell me that you may be tainted and I go along with it. Maybe this was all a mistake!" Oliver felt the need step in so he asked again, this time yelling the question "What is the idea, what are you all doing here?" Looking around Oliver, Lucas, and Sofia noticed that most of the camp was staring at them now. Humbled they closed their circle and kept their voices down. "We're harvesting tress..." Lucas began before Sofia cut him off "We're going to make the entire Andmore fleet able to sail underwater!", Oliver thought about this for a second, then asked "You were coming to rescue me?" But he already knew the answer to this question, "Yes," Sofia said sheepishly. Looking at Oliver she relented "You have to understand that they didn't just attack us, they destroyed these cities livlihoods. Things won't be the same for at lest a generation. Someone needs to pay for that." "So you go to war?" Oliver left the question hanging in the air and thought about what Osto had told him, and about the Shadow Cat who had been inside Orless and the Shadow Fish he'd seen the night before. Then decided what he needed to do, "You can't go to war with the merfolk, the shadow is growing more powerful and it's preparing to attack the merfolk.", Oliver's tried to stay calm and hoped he'd make his point. "Great! More allies for us!" Sofia quipped back but Lucas cast her a stern look. "Oliver what do you mean the shadow is going to attack the merfolk?" Lucas asked seriously. "Just on the other side of this ridge there's a pool, in there are hundreds of shadow fish, they're getting ready for something, and it's not just the merfolk they're going to attack either. There was a shadow cat in Orless, and another one north of the city at a farm. The merfolk think a war with the shadow is coming and their worried that we're going to take the side of the shadow so they attacked first but we have to put that aside and show them that we'll stand with them." Oliver took a breath and hoped that they'd understand. Lucas looked concerned "Shadow fish... but the water was always safe... How did you come to learn about all of this?" Lucas finally asked, "Osto, well Prince Osto of the Southern Deep technically, he's the merfolk that saved me, he's on his way back to Inbrov now to convice the king that they need to be focused on the fight with the shadow and not on us." Oliver replied. Sofia got up and stared at Oliver with those same hate filled eyes she'd trained on him when she had first learned his secret, "And you believe this merfolk? You know it's more likely that he's told you this to put us at ease while he goes back and rallies his troops!" "Sofia!", Lucas shouted then quickly lowered his voice as he continued talking, "if the shadow is getting ready to attack the merfolk, then our problems are bigger than flooded cellars and burned graineries." "Listen to yourself.", Sofia was visibly upset as she said it, "You're worried about some shadowy evil force when the people who destroyed your city are out there, and we can attack them!?" Lucas sighed and seemed defeated, Oliver thought maybe if he explained but before he could say anything Sofia let another angry retort fly off. "It doesn't matter what you think, the King wants to do this, we're in his forest, and it's his men who are out ther cutting down trees." with that she turned and started to storm off to the ladders. "Where are you going?" Oliver called, "To make sure that nothing gets in our way!" Sofia yelled back and then started to climb.
Lucas beconned Oliver into a tent and the two of them entered. The tents were small but had beds that they could sit on to talk and while Oliver felt the fabric sides didn't do much to keep conversations private not feeling like everyone at the camp was looking at them was probably for the best. "Your friend is a bit hot headed." Lucas said after they'd settled, sheepishly Oliver responded "She saved me from a shadow cat in Orless." Lucas thought about this for a minute then asked "In the city proper?" "Right outside of the sorcerers guild." "Wandering beyond the edges of the shadow lands is one thing, but to actually enter the city..." Lucas trailed off then gave Oliver a serious look and asked, "What happened to you in the shadow land?". Oliver thought about the winding path that he ended up taking since he left Andmore and then realizing how stupid he'd been he said softly "I found Valeria." Lucas' eyes turned from serious to rage filled. "You were supposed to go straight to Orless." he said chastizing Oliver, "But she was keeping Nicolas from leaving the northern sea, and she had tried to kill me, and all I had to do was take her merstone and break the enchantment, and then she was free, and..." Oliver has started rambling when Lucas cut him off, "Free!" Lucas' anger seemed to be turning to resignation, "I should never have sent you through the shadow lands, better to have risked going by boat to Orless. You understand that freeing Valeria is like freeing the stopper from a cask, there's a reason it was trapped in the first place!", "I don't understand," Oliver was confused, "I read your diary, she was being held captive by the shadow and corrupted, and when I took her merstone and it shattered then the enchantments she'd placed on things lifted." Lucas looked wearily at Oliver and then taking a breath said, "You have gone through much and I owe you a real explaination, as much as there is one to give. When Valeria and I were in the shadow lands it's true the shadow took a particular interest in her, it began to infect her enchantments and her mind, turning them dark. This started when we found Delfina's tower, you know why she built that tower right?" Oliver thought for a moment, "I know she was using it to study the travel stone that I found", "It was modified for those purposes, but the tower was built so that she could learn lost arts that the sorcerers in Orless had forbidden the study of. You see the part of the tower we see above ground is only a small part of it. The tower is built on foundation that extends deep into the rock and reaches the fires below that still hold the raw magical energy that makes the shadow lands so enchanted. The whole tower is a conductor that allows a sorcerer who is in tune with it to be immensely powerful. Valeria being as gifted as she was able to connect instantly with the tower. While I spent days reading books written by a dead mad woman she tried to use the enchantments in the tower to find our way out of the shadow land. Little did she know that by exposing herself to all that raw energy she was allowing it to taint her the same way it has countless others. I believe it was after we left the tower that she realized what had happened and that she had to stay. You see the shadow is strong, and evil, but it is also trapped by the enchantments that seperate the shadow land for our lands. A sorceress as skilled as Valeria could break those enchantments if she wished, or if she was forced to. If she had returned to our lands then she would have turned to shadow herself and unleashed on Andmore and Orless the very thing that you're worried about. And so we spent time in the shadow lands learning to survive, as she led us deeper and deeper. When I was finally forced to abandon her I had all the skills I needed to get back to Andmore, then she made one last sacrifice, letting the shadow think she was it's servant but really trapping it's ambitions by binding herself to the land so that she could not leave and therefore could never break the enchantments that held back the shadow." Oliver thought about what he had overhead the sorcerers saying that night hidden in the library before the attack, and what Valeria had said herself, that he didn't know what he'd done, he thought about the last time he'd seen her as he climbed the cliff to escape the shadow cats, "she sacrified herself to save me", Oliver said somberly. Lucas replied "She made that sacrifice long ago, the binding that held her to the shadow lands was not something easily undone, or else it would have been. She was destined to spend the rest of her life in that horrible place." Olive and Lucas both sat in silence, then Oliver aseked, "You're worried that Sofia is tainted by the shadow too?", "I wasn't until I found out you went to that tower." said Lucas, "This attack on the merfolk, what I know now casts it in a new light. The merfolk may have attacked us as the first battles in the war against the shadow but we may now deliver a decisive victory for the shadow if we're not careful." "We have to stop her then" Oliver said, Lucas looked defeated, "No she's right that she gets her athority here directly from the King, she spoke directly to him and he agreed to this plan. I'm in no position to oppose her or him directly. But..." Lucas paused for a moment in thought, "I may have an idea, I'll need to return to the castle, do you wish to join me, or remain here?" Oliver couldn't imagine any reason he would want to remain sitting in a tent, "I want to go with you" he responded quickly. Lucas leapt to his feet and led Oliver outside over to where several men sat around waggons talking and drinking. "We need to return to the castle at-once!" Lucas said in a commanding voice, the men looked up at him and then one rose and started the process of preparing a waggon.

#Chapter 33. The Story of Delfina López
Back at the castle Lucas led Oliver back to his tower, there he set about writing on paper and producing various potions, finally getting a medium sized flask purple liquid bubbling away of a small fire. "This plan will take some time" Lucas said turning to Oliver before asking, "Would you like to return to your world while we wait?" Oliver remembered the brief moment of waking, was it a dream or... "Yes!" he said quickly. Lucas fetched ingredients and began to mix another small vial of potion, adding Oliver's hair and seeing it turn the deep red color. As Oliver watched he thought about Delfina, "You learned this potion from Delfina, from her journal right?" Oliver asked, "Yes, she was a truely amazing sorceress, although as it turns out quite crazy." Lucas replied. "What happened to her?" Oliver asked, "after she went back to the guild?", Lucas looked sad again "She was imprisoned for her crimes. Her talk of traveling between worlds made many fear her but from the tales I've heard her mind had long since lost any semblance of order. Some scolars visited her to try to learn the truth but in the end she died in prison. Her story now lives on as a warning for not defecting or taking up with pirates. Much good that did me and Valeria, or your friend Sofia for that matter." with that Lucas inspected the purple liquid in the flask, let out a satisfied chuckle, snatached up a paper he'd written, rolled it and dropped it into the flask. The paper disolved and dissapeared, the liquid in the flask turned clear. With that Lucas snuffed the flame, and poured the flask out into a drain at the back of the tower. "What was that?" Oliver asked curiously, Lucas just smiled and said "hopefully it was a way to avert war, but only time will tell." Grabbing the small vial of traveling potion that had now turned clear Lucas handed it to Oliver and said, "I do not know what your world holds, but I hope it is less perilous than this one." Oliver took the vial and drank it all, feeling himself fall to the foor and into blackness.
Oliver awoke to bright lights and a periodic beeping. His vision was blurey but as it started to focus he was blue curtains and then looking down realized he was in a bed and his mom was sitting on a chair reading a book, but where was he? He raised an arm to push himself up and saw a tube running from the back of his hand, he followed the tubing and there was an IV bag, drip driping clear liquid and next to it a hearrate monitor giving off a period beep beep. He was in a hospital. He struggled to push himself up giveing a little grunt. His mom's eyes shot up out of the book and she immediately stood up and ran to his bed, hugging and kissing him crying "You're awake, thank god!" "What happened?" Oliver asked, his mom gave him more kisses before stepping back a half step, "You got sick at Steven's house, the doctors don't know what it was but you fell down and hit your head and when Steven's mom couldn't wake you up she called an ambulance and they brought you here. The doctors said you were fine but you were in a coma and they weren't sure when you were going to wake up, but now, you're awake! Oh my god, you're awake!", "How long was I out for?" Oliver asked, "Not long, just a few hours, it's," she checked her watch, "It's only 7 am! I'm going to get a doctor, let's get you out of here and home." "We can go home?" Oliver asked remembering the large hole in his bedroom and the police blocking the driveway. "Yes, the police called me yesterday, they're all done checking on the house, and we can go back, you're going to have to sleep in the guest room of course but look that doesn't matter, the point is that you're awake and we can go home." With that she gave him a kiss, pushed past the curtain and Oliver heard the soft clicks of a door opening and closing. Oliver thought about what she'd said about hitting his head, it hadn't been a dream after all then, he must have managed to come back here without the potion that one time but how?
The remainder of the morning was a series of doctors and nurses entereing and leaving Oliver's room, blood was drawn, IVs were removed, a cup of pudding was brought in then a bland sandwich. Oliver's mom had insisted that they were leaving today and the doctors could do what they needed to but by the end of the day they would be home. Sometime after the bland sandwich a doctor came and shined a light in Olvier's eyes and then asked him some simple math questions, and who the first president of the united states was, after that he had a stern looking conversation with his mom that Oliver couldn't overhead and then his Mom came in beeming. "We're going home!" she said. Steven's mom had brought over the overnight bag Oliver packed, he'd thrown up on his Pjamas the night before and the hospital had put him in one of the standard backless gowns but now getting up on his own two feet and putting on his own clothes felt good. His mom signed some forms and an orderly entered with a wheelchair Oliver would have to ride in it until he got to their car. A few minutes later and Oliver was buckled into the backseat and they were off. The first stop was Grace's friend's hosue to pickup Grace and then with the 2 kids in the back the drove to their house and pulled into the driveway. A pickup truck was parked just outside on the street and as they got out a man climbed out of the pickup truck and approached them. "Chris Wilson, D&W construction", the man introduced himself offering Oliver's mom a hand, "Diane Fletcher, I think I talked to a Joan earlier." "Yeah Joan handles all our scheduling but I'm here to do the estimate." "Come right this way" Oliver's mom said leading everyone indoors. "I hope everything is ok, I heard you were in the hospital?" Chris said as they entered the house, "You can leave your shoes on." Oliver's mom said instinctively as Chris stepped into the door. Reaching into his pocket Chris pulled out a set of disposable bootie covers and said "Never leave home without them" sliding them over his boots. Oliver's mom gave a smile and then answered the original question, "Thank you for asking. it seems like everything will be ok." her tone was optimistic. Grace ran up to her room, Oliver made his way up to the guest bedroom, while their mom led Chris upstairs to Oliver's room. Dropping his overnight bag on the bed Oliver remembered that he had the travel stone in his pocket last night. Opening the bag he found a trash bag that his pjamas had been thrown in, they reeked of throwup Oliver felt like he was going to be sick again, quickly he reached into the pocket thankfully finding the travel stone still there, grabbed it and tied the bag shut.
Sitting alone in the guest room Oliver looked the travel stone over and over again. He thought about everything he'd learned about this little rock over the last few days in Alland, about it's origins, real and supposed, and about how it had come to be in his world. He thought about his Great Great Uncle becoming obsessed with this world and wanting to travel here, and poor Tomas who had become trapped for so long in his world. Then he thought about Delfina, she had bonded with the stone and traveled back for some reason. Lucas had said she died a prisoner of the sorcerers guild and that she was crazy, but it wasn't like he'd known her personally, she was a cautionary tale told to sorcerers. Oliver left the guest room and headed down to the basement and logged on to the family's computer. Opening the internet he searched "Delfina López" none of the pages that returned seemed relevent. Maybe something on the Diamandis estate website? The visited there and went through the pages, not seeing any mention of Delfina López, then on a biography of Gregory Diamandis he had scrolled all the way to the end when he saw a citation reading, Opituary of Gregory Diamandis, Town Harold. The Town Harold was the local newspaper, Oliver went onto their website and much to his delight there was a "search our old issues" button. There was some text at the top explaining that the paper had partnered with a university to make the old issues available online and searchable, and giving thanks to generous donations from a few select patrons that were mentioned. Oliver typed into the search field "Delfina López" after a few minutes the page refreshed and there was one exact match, the obituary of Delifina López. Clicking onto it the computer displayed a scan of the short article, next to it the article's text transcribed with a button labeled "report inconsistencies", Oliver read.

```
Delfina López died in her sleep yesterday at her home at the age of 42. Often known as a companion to Gregory Diamandis Delfina was for a time a fixture on the social set until a public mental breakdown led to her hospitalization. Since then she's remained reclusive. She has no surviving relatives and a private service will be held at St. Matthews on Saturday the 24th.
```

Above the article was a black and white, the man Oliver regonized as Gregory, the woman beside him he presumed to be Delfina, they both looked young and dressed up like they were going out to a fancy dinner or concert. The photo was captioned, "Delfina López (right) out with her friend Gregory Diamandis (left)." Oliver looked at the picture closer and there, on her neck barely visible in the blurey photo he thought he could see a merstone necklace.
Chris Wilson had left after talking Oliver's mom through what needed to be done, and putting up a tarp to close off the opening. Now allowed to go back into his own room Oliver entered, gathered some things he'd need for the night and thought about what he'd read. Delfina had used the travel stone to get back to Alland and then been imprisioned, she must have been unable to perform enchantments so she was trapped, living out the rest of her life in prison. Oliver thought about how she had described the travel stone as having worked on the mind, and how weary Gregory was becoming when he returned from traveling for years in a single night. He realized that if war broke out in Alland, he could become trapped there just like Delfina had been, there was nothing he could do here to stop it but maybe when he went to sleep tonight he would never wake up again. If that did happen what would he want to get done before he died? He thought about his friends, and school, his mother calling "Dinner!" from downstairs interupted his train of thought.
Dinner that night was Chinese food, the family ate and then his mom brought out some board games to play. Oliver protested thinking that he should spend more time getting ready for what may be the rest of his life in Alland but his mom was insistant. "2 nights ago there was an explosion that could have killed you if we were home, then last night you hit your head and were going to be in a coma forever, so tonight I'm going to spend time with you and we're going to have fun." Oliver tried to explain that the coma wasn't really his fault so he should have to do anything because of it but his mom gave him a stern look and he gave in to board games. It was late by the time the three of them turned in. Oliver at first headed into his own bedroom, autopilot, then realizing his mistake as he staired at the large tarp covering the whole in the side of the house he headed for the guest room, and put on Pjamas. Sitting in bed he examined the travel stone again and thought about how Delfina had described the intriquite enchantment captured inside the stone. The way that Osto had described it as a weapon built for a future war scared Oliver, but how could it be used as a weapon, look at Tomas who after touching it spent 40 years in this world, Gregory who even with Delfina took long study to be able to even come back here. Delfina had said that her potions worked off of imperfections in the enchantment itself, if that was the case then was the stone always intended for a one way trip? His mind wandered and soon enough he felt himself drifting and then falling asleep.

#Chapter 34. The Fleet
Oliver awoke in Lucas room. It was early morning and the sorcerer wasn't there. Going to the window he half expected another merfolk attack but the bay was actually relatively empty of ships, trade between the cities had largely stalled due to the attacks. Heading out of the castle he found the gates open and made his way down to the city docks. Here along the inlet 20 boats of various sizes were being swarmed over by workers. Men were pulling planks off the boats and carrying them to shore. Sofia had mentioned that the Andmore navy would be able to sail underwater and this must be the retrofitting that was happening. The trees that had been marked by Sofia and Lucas at the edge of the shadow land would be felled and turned into boards, those boards would be inscribed according to the merfolk designs that Gregory and Delfina had discovered and then the planks relaid on these boats. Oliver wasn't sure how long the process would take but he imagined with the number of men working it would all be done in a few days, if nothing went wrong that is. Strolling along the Harbour Oliver heard a familiar voice and then saw a familar ship. Shadow Run was docked, it had clearly suffered heavy damage but like with the other ships teams of men seemed to be busy repairing and retrofitting the boat. The voice boomed. "No not like that! Let me see it, you people don't know how to build a proper boat do you!?" There on the deck of shadow run Oliver saw Nicolas, his finer clothes had been abandoned for a simple shirt and pants and he was chastisizing a worker who was attempting to make repairs to damage on the main mast. "Nicolas!" Oliver called out, Nicolas' eyes lifted and then seeing Oliver handed the tools back to the worker and said "Here!" and hurried off to meeting him.
The Shadow Run it turned out was a much heartier boat than the merfolk who had attacked them in the cave had expected. The men left onboard had managed to fight their way away from the cave and not wanting to split their force the merfolk had let the ship limp away. After they had returned to the cave and found Oliver missing Sofia, Matias and most of the other pirates had returned to the shadow lands, Nicolas took a few of his men and rowed out into the bay. It had taken him the better part of a day to find the shadow run, barely staying afloat with the damage it had taken, but they were able to return collect Sofia, Matias and the others and then make their way to Andmore. "Where they almost sank me for piracy, till I ran up a flag of surrendar" Nicolas said spinning on the ground as he did so. "And now it's getting fit to be able to sail underwater?" Oliver asked, Nicolas smiled, "Just like Gregory's, I'll tell you after we defeat those merfolk I may just setup shop in that grotto like he did. Nice place as long as the merfolk aren't after you. But what happened to you boy! Last we knew the merfolk had captured you, or killed you." Oliver gave Nicolas an abridged version of his story leaving out Osto, capture, escape, then back to the cave - in this version he'd hired a boat - and then through the shadow lands again to Andmore where he found Sofia in the forest. At mention of Sofia Nicolas beemed, "You know sorceresses, they're supposed to be bad luck on boats, almost didn't help you back in Rockedge because of her, but now that I've seen her fight, I'm thinking I may make her first mate, have a powerful sorceress to strike fear into may enemies like old Gregory did, ha?" Oliver just nodded and then bidding Nicolas farewell he headed off to explore
the port some more.
It was almost noon and various food stalls had started to setup to sell food and drink to the workers who were busy at the port. Nicolas had given Oliver some silver so Oliver found a vendor stoking a small but hot fire and paid for some sort of fried vegetable. He continued wandering and eventually made his way to the end of the inlet. Here a small stone bridge crossed the water at it's narrowest, but beyond he could see the inlet became a narrow stream and climbed into the mountains. He wondered if he followed the stream if it would take him back to the opening in the cliff and the cave he had come through to get here. Across the inlet was the fishing village, largely reduced to chared wreckage in the merfolk attack anything that wasn't destroyed was being pulled apart and used to build new home, buildings with the core intact were haveing new walls put up. Amazed by the speed, and he imagined incredible low quality, of the work being done Oliver thought that no sign of the fire would likely be here in another week. These houses were outside the protection of the city walls so Oliver was able to walk right down to the edge of the bay and look out across it. He imagined far a spec would be the city of Orless, and there another spec would be rockedge. Another day or 2 and the fleet would be ready to sail and then Oliver could picture all these boats filing out of the inlet, fanning out along the bay and then sailing underwater. Oliver took the long way back to the castle winding through the streets of Andmore, he saw some buildings damaged by the fire here and ther but nothing subtantial. Then rounding a corner he saw it. A large rectangular building, or what would have been one. It had been completely reduced by fire to almost just rubble. The streets around it seemed to be setup to allow carts to easily reach many different openings along it's edges, but with the roof collapsed and the walls broken Oliver had to guess what would have been inside, this must have been the city's grainery. He imagined how tall the building must have been, and how full it must have been with grain, he thought about Carlos' wagon full of Oranges and imagined how many hundreds of wagon fulls this building had held, now all gone.
It was late by the time he returned to the castle, the gate was closed and Oliver worried for a moment that he would have to spend the night in the city, or maybe down at the docks? Just then a guard appeared at the gate, Oliver recognized him as the same guard who had arrested him that first day in Andmore, "Oh you, I suppose you'll be wanting to see Lucas" The guard said, a note of complaint in his voice, he stepped out of sight and then from a small door in an alcove on the outside wall appeared again, "This way!" The hallway was narrow but lead back to the inside of the gate, perfect defense Oliver thought, it would be easy to block the way from any attacker and meant you could leave the big gate closed all night long. "He's in the main hall, they're expecting you!" the guard said gesturing at the castle. Oliver entered the castle through the unlocked front doors and after a bit of poking around found King Adem, the Queen, Lucas, Sofia, Nicolas, Matias, and others he didn't recognize seated at a long table. As he entered the room the king becconed him, "Come sit" he commanded. Matias for his part stood, bowed to the king, then ran over to give Oliver a big hug. "Good to know you're not captive or dead!" Matias said giving Oliver a smile. Taking his seat Oliver was brought a bowl of soup that tasted like some kind of root vegetable. "Now where were we?" The King asked, turning to Sofia, "Report on the logging?" "The trees are cut, and were being turned to planks when I returned to the castle, we'll have them engraved and ready for fitting by midday tomorow." Sofia's report was quick and to-the-point. "Will you be ready for them?" The king asked turning to a man Oliver hadn't met. "Yes sir," the man said adding "our ships -" Nicolas cut in loudly "and mine!", the man resumed, "yes our ships and the shadow run, will be ready for new planks by morning.". "Good", the king seemed pleased then turned, "the men?" he asked. Oliver hadn't recognized the man before when entering but he saw now that it was Sir Eren who spoke up. "Thanks to Matias here we're prepared on how to fight the Merfolk." Matias nodded in appreciation, "although I have to say sir that the plan seems crazy to sail underwater to an underwater city and somehow fight with swords?", "Thankyou commander" the king said not acknolaging Sir Eren's concerns. The king now turned to Oliver and giving a grin asked him "Now Oliver, the last time we saw each other you swore to me you'd be breaking that enchantment that pulled the merfolk to our city in the first place. How is that quest going?" "Um" Oliver was at a loss for words, he had so far only learned that there was very little he could do about the travel stone, afterall Delfina who knew more about it than anyone had never figured out how to overcome it permanently, "Ok I guess" was Oliver's answer. "Well Oliver I release you from that quest as your friends have brought me quite the interesting proposal that I'm told you are the mastermind of." Oliver just nodded, he wasn't sure if he liked to be the mastermind of a plan to start a war but at least he wasn't being put to death for failing in his sworn duty.
With dinner completed Lucas quickly stood and brought Oliver with him back to the tower, there in his lab Lucas turned to Oliver and asked, "Where you able to learn anything in your world, anything that could help us stop the war?" Oliver thought for a minute about the little he'd learned about Delfina and then defeated said, "No". "Think" Lucas implored him, "if we can break that enchantment we may be able to avert the war." Oliver thought about the war? "The travel stone is supposed to be a weapon to stop the war, that's what the merfolk say, but now it's in my world, maybe there's some way to use it still? - Wait". Grabbing is bag Oliver took out the pages that he'd torn from the book in the Sorcerer's library. In all the excitment since that night he'd never even looked them. "I found these," Oliver said spreading the pages out on the table, as he did he saw drawn clearly in the middle of one of the pages was a detailed sketch of the travel stone, "this must have - " before he could finish his sentance Lucas interrupted him, "Where did you get that?", "When Orless was flooded I found it in the Sorcerers library." Oliver offered, the look on Lucas' face spoke of a profound dissapointment that Oliver hadn't expected from someone who was clearly not on the best of terms with the sorcerers guild. "So you thought because of the flooding you should just destory books?" the aligation from Lucas stung Oliver, "No, I couldn't carry it, and it seemed like it would hold the answers..." Oliver paused, the anger and hurt the Lucas was showing didn't make sense, curious he asked "Why is it so important?" Lucas sighed slightly and just stared at the page, then said "It was Valeria's book, well, she wrote it that is to say". Oliver looked at the pages spread out in front of him. The writing on the pages were large and hand written in small neat letters, he hadn't seen Valeria write while they were in the shadow lands but he imagined a pen in her fingers and saw how they could create such small and perfect letters. Knowing now the author of the book Oliver began to read the text at the top of the page.

```
The travel stone is said to be an ancient merfolk artifact, study by Delfina Lopez suggests that it was forged in the heart of Mount Alland before the erruption. The enchantment on the stone itself is flawed suffering ommissions in the <inscrutable characters> and <inscrutable character> positions. Due to these flaws the travel stone transmits only the mind and does not permit returning. Further study is required to determine the corrections that must be made to account for these flaws. As the stone has been taken to another world it is currently beyond our reach, but if the corrections can be determined then our calculations show that enough raw power exists beneath Inbrov to allow a new stone to be forged.
```

After the drawing of the Travel stone the remainder of the page was a series of gibberish symbols. Oliver looked at Lucas, pointing, "What is all this?" He asked, "Enchantment Notation" Lucas said flatly. "Before we decided to leave Orless, even before we were together, Valeria began a study of Delfina Lopez. She had dissapeared some 40 years before, run off with a pirate and died in a forgotten waterry grave was what we were told to scare us from doing the same. But then she shows up one day, looking crazy, and to those that had known her before, not a day older. She was arrested of course, charged with deserting her postings, turning on the guild, and unnaturally extending her life. All of which led to her being held until she died here.", Lucas paused for a moment as if to consider the next part of the story, "Valeria knew her?" Oliver asked, "Yes quite well," Lucas said returning to his story, "After Delfina's arrest a promising young sorceress was assigned to study her, it was then that Valeria began to believe her tales of traveling between worlds. They actually wrote this book together in a way. Delfina recalling from her fractured memory many of the specific enchantments and studies she had done. The masters for their part hadn't given much thought to the assignment until they saw the volume of writing that they had done together for this book. They feared the work that they didn't understand and so Valeria was told to finish quickly and prohibited from seeing Delfina. But fearing the research she'd already done the master's went a step to far, they prohibited Valeria from research at-all and instead left her with more administrative work. She became bored and I think it was ultimately my offer of romance that gave her a way to escape from that boredom."
Lucas stared at the pages in thought for a few minutes, then snatched up the one with the drawing of the merstone, and held it close to his eyes, muttering to himself, "Interesting... but, no, maybe, but, oh!" he smiled. "What?" Oliver asked, "Mind binding!" Lucas said putting the paper down on the table, Oliver looked confused and waited for the sorcerer to explain. Lucas however crossed to a bookshelf and tore through one volume after another until stoping, reading a few pages, and then his soulders sank as he looked at Oliver. "What is it?" Oliver asked, "The stone" Lucas began, "moves your mind between your world, and our world, when you're here it's just a projection of your mind, your body is back in your world. Are you understanding so far?" Oliver wasn't entirely sure he was but nodded yes, "The decoupling of mind and body is a flaws in the enchantment, a flaw that Delfina was seeking to fix so that mind and body could stay together, but rather than fix them we can exploit them. Mind binding links two minds together, a weak form of it is used by the sorcerers to speed up some of the training that we do at the guild, but in a stronger form it would have an more permanent effect of joining together 2 minds, permanent enough that the enchantment expecting mind and body but instead finding 2 closely connected minds should let you pull the bound mind back with you into your world. Whomever was bound like this would be like you, their body here but a projection of their mind there." "And they'd come back when I came back?" Oliver asked, "Yes, unless your minds became unbound in your own world, then they would be trapt there forever." "What do you mean by unbound?" Oliver didn't like the sound of it. "Well that's one problem" Lucas said, "We won't be able to break the binding from our world becuase your minds won't be here, there's no magic in your world, so that won't work. When we do this as students sometimes a particularly strong mind can throw off the binding on it's own. But a binding this powerful it would be dangerous for both minds if it happened. I'm not going to lie there's a chance you could die, or go insane." Oliver thought about Gregory longing to travel to his world, Tomas driven to break into his home to get back, and Delfina suffering a mental break and being locked in prison in this world. It may be that insanity was inevitable. "What is the other problem?" Oliver asked, "Other problem?", it look Lucas a minute to realize what Olvier was talking about, "ah yeah, well to do an enchantment this powerful we'd need to get to a raw source of magic like the one in Delfina's tower." Oliver imagined venturing for a thrid time into the shadow lands and found while he had generally hoped to never go there again the prospect was less worrisome than going insane, "But this can help us win the war?" Oliver asked expectantly. "Well, maybe, I haven't figured that out yet. But look it solves a problem." "What problem is that?" "You said it yourself the stone is supposed to be a weapon to end the war but it's stuck in your world, by doing this it's like having the stone back here, now we just need to figure out how we were supposed to use it in the first place."
Oliver and Lucas talked through various ideas until it grew dark, Oliver headed down a few floors and found an empty bedroom curling up in the uncomfortable bed he fell fast alseep.

#Chapter 35. Prisoners
Oliver awoke early in the morning and went to go upstairs to find Lucas, to his surprise his door wouldn't open. He banged on it but there was no response. Not sure what to do Oliver sat on the bed and began to think more of the problems of last night, how could the travel stone have been intended as a weapon. If the trips to Oliver's world were supposed to be one-way then it would be like a slow death sentance for anyone who touched the stone, but then why not just kill them. Is it possible it was intended to be a bobbytrap of sorts, some unsuspecting enemy binds to the stone and then is trapped in Oliver's world. He couldn't figure it out. Finally after what seemed like forever the door opened, a guard he didn't recognize came in and ordered him to go. "What's going on?" Oliver asked as he left the room "Just go!" the guard said pushing him.
Oliver was lead into the main castle to a large room where the King sat, there on the floor kneeling was Lucas his face looked red from where someone had been hitting him. Oliver was forced to kneel down and had his hands tied behind his back. "What's going on!?" he asked again, King Adem glared at him from the chair, "Last night a merfolk calling himself Prince Osto arrived at our port looking for you, he said he meant no harm but my men apprehended him and brought him here for questioning. Then this morning my delegation to Orless returns and I find out that while they were there bargining with the sorcerers guild to send people to man our boats something spooked the sorcerers and they were suddently turned away. Now Sofia confided in me that you and Lucas were having second thoughts about this whole attack. So I thought I'd have Lucas questioned, he has of-course admitted to sending a message to the sorcerers warning them not to help us. But now I'm curious what your role in this whole plot is, why are there merfolk showing up at my city seeking you, and why as you arrive does my sorcerer suddenly betray me?!" the king was seething with rage as he spoke. Nervously Oliver spoke, "The war is a mistake - ", Lucas cut him off, "He didn't know what I was do-" a guard slapped the sorcerer across the face and he was silent. "It's true," Oliver picked up, "I didn't know what he was doing, I told him what I'd seen and he aggreed with me that it would be a mistake to go to war." "Yes yes I know, the shadow is the real enemy and this sorceress Sofia is tainted by the shadow." The king's tone seemed to dismiss the story. "This man is a traitor!" King Adem's tone was angry and pointed to Lucas, "He will be put to death, and why shouldn't I execute you too?" Oliver was at a loss for words, he was about to plead for his life when a guard entered the room and whispered something to the king. The king nodded and the guard exited the doors opened and a man called out "Captain Lysander Bouras!" Oliver turned. There in strode the captain of The Silver Eel, when he saw Oliver Lysander smiled and said "Good to see you alive little one" then he stopped and made a flourish to the king, "Your grace!". The king looked displeased he spoke in a commanding voice to Lysander, "This is the second time in almost as many days I've had a pirate present themselves before me for something other than execution, so speak quickly or I may decide to execute you anyway." Lysander rose and cooly spoke, "I come bearing gifts, 8 sorcerers who did not agree with their guild's decision not to head your plea for aid and wished to provide their services", Lysander gestured to the door and through it walked 8 people, men and women some tall, some shorter, but all clad in the blue robes of the sorcerers guild. The king rose and looked over the assembled sorcerers then addressing the guards near Oliver and Lucas commanded "Lock them away", as they were escorted away Oliver could hear the king asking for the oath of each of the sorcerers.
Oliver and Lucas were escorted through more mazes of passages until they reached the large room that Oliver had been taken to on his first day in Andmore. There the same door had it's heavy bolt moved and Oliver and Lucas were pushed into the dark room and the door closed behind them. "Remember when I rescued you from here?" Lucas said with a chuckle, "I'd almost forgotten" Oliver gave a snappy reply. "Oliver?" a hoarse voice from the darkness said, "Osto?" Oliver asking thinking he recognized the voice. "Yes, it's so good you're here!" "In prison?" Oliver asked incrediously, "No in Andmore, alive, that's what really matters." Osto explained, "I came to the city last night, my brother has agreed to hold off his forces while I win the humans to our side, but I was arrested and I feared that perhaps you hadn't made it Andmore and conveyed the warning to your people." Osto's words broke Oliver's heart, he had conviced ther merfolk to not attack and what had Oliver achieved. "I wasn't so successful" is all Oliver could say leaving the room in silence, "You're Prince Osto of the southern deep?" Lucas asked into the darkness and using the full honorific. The reply came back like a hoarse whisper, "I am, and you are Lucas Álvarez, Royal Sorcerer of Andmore?" "I must ask, do you have any enchantments that you can use to help us?" Lucas' voice was strained as he asked the question, "Not so far from the water I'm afraid." Ostos reply seemed to leave dissapointment in the air. Seeking to fill the space Oliver piped in "Osto since we last spoke I've learned more about the travel stone, and I have some questions", "Where did you learn these things?" Osto's voice had a note of suspicion in it. "In the shadow lands I found a tower it belowed to Delifna López the sorceress who traveled with the pirate Gergory Diamandis. She'd written a whole book on the stone." Osto was silent for a moment, "She had the stone in her posession for quite some time, anything she has said about the stone is likely correct." Oliver picked back up, "She didn't understand the merfolk legends, not like you do, please if the stone was made as a weapon I need to understand how we could use it. Maybe if we have a weapon we can convince the king to free us." Oston replied in a hoarse voice, "As I've told you young Oliver the stone is mostly legend to us." Oliver decided it was best to just get out what he was trying to say, "Delfina didn't think the stone was forged in Inbrov, she thought it was forged in Mount Alland." "hmm..." Osto grew quiet for a minute before talking, "It would make sense, the stone appears as legend already in all our stories, but how could it be forged as a weapon against the shadow if it was made before the war, before the shadow even existed?" Lucas had been quiet until this time steped in, "Perhaps it wasn't forged as a weapon against the shadow but for him?" "Impossible!", there was a note of indignation beneath the rasp in Osto's voice. "But if it was forged by merfolk at mount Alland, then they must have traveled inland to the caldera, they must have been working with the shadow!" Osto didn't respond, Lucas chimed in coming to the merfolk's defense, "Before he was corrupted by evil the shadow was a meer human, I imagine many who didn't share his evil ways wanted to learn more by plumbing the origins of enchantments.", Osto chimed back in, "It may be that you are right, the stone is clearly of merfolk origin, and the only direct source of enchantment that it could have been drawn from is Mount Alland, but then why venerate it as a weapon against the shadow if it was one built as one for it?", the three remained silent for some time puzzeling over the nature of the stone, then Oliver asked, "How do enchantments work?" Lucas gave a little laugh, "What's funny?" Oliver asked, Osto chimed in, "What is funny Oliver is that the subject of how enchantments work is a much deeper study then we will likely have time for in this cell." "Fine, but I guess what does it mean for an enchantment to have flaws." Lucas sighed, "Ok, look deep within the earth there's raw magical power, some of that power comes up to the surface and seeps into the soil, the plants and animals, as it does so it seperates into it's component parts like light passing through a prism. So something like a Sun Lily has this pure light enchantment in it. That's why the Shadow cats don't like them. What sorcerers do is recombine those different parts in a way to make an enchantment, think of it like cooking, you combine the same ingredents in different ways to get very different results. A flaw is just that, it's a mistake that happens, it's hard to explain how someone who is trained see's enchantments, but complete they're like 3 dancers moving in harmony, take away one of those dancers and you get a sense for what it's like to look at a flawed enchantment. Why do you ask?" "Delfina said that the stone was flawed, that's how the potioned she discovered worked", Osto chimed in again, "Merstones cannot be flawed, our process is different than what hummans do, we use the raw magical energy directly." "So..." Oliver thought for a moment, "She was mistaken?" "Or something was removed" Lucas said, "the potion works on the flaws of the enchantment, which means that that without those flaws - " Oliver interrupted excitedly, "Then the stone could be used to travel back and forth without needing the potion to return." "This is a possibility" Osto said, "but why modify the stone?" Olvier was ready with the answer, "Like you said, it's a weapon, by removing the ability to return from the stone it becomes a death sentance. But then why not just kill the person, why go through the bother to send them to another world and wait till they got old and died when you could just kill them here?" "Unless of course, the thing you were trying to kill doesn't have a body?" Osto's question was simple and Oliver knew the answer to it in a moment "The shadow" "Have you head of a mind binding?" Lucas aksed getting excited, Osto assumed the question was for him, "I have but our minds don't work like yours do so we don't have much need for this enchantment." "But if I could bind Oliver's mind and the shadow's mind then" - "No" Osto cut in, "It's too dangerous, and besides the shadow isn't like a mind, it's not contained". Osto, Oliver, and Lucas sat for sometime thinking about this, then all of a sudden the door to the cell opened, bloodied and breathing heavily was Matias, "Come, you have to help!"
Matias had done a slight double take when Osto had emerged from the cell but if it was shock from what had happened or Oliver and Lucas vouching for the merfolk Matias decided it wasn't worth starting a fight. "What happened?" Oliver asked as Matias led them through tunnels to the, "They were waiting for us," Matias said, "As soon as we got out of the harbour and the ships dove underwater there was the entire merfolk army waiting for us. We only had 9 ships to begin with and just seeing that army, one of those sorcerers that had come over from Orless freaked out and dropped the enchantment, the whole boat was lost. One of the other captains saw that and decided this wasn't worth the glory and he'd rather be executed on land and turned his boat back. At that point what could we do, we only had 7 ships against an entire army, but the merfolk were upon us. We were outnumbered and outmatched, the merfolk could move on and off our boats, coming in engaging with the soliders and then jumping back into the water where we couldn't touch them. They targeted the sorcerers who couldn't defend themselves or else risk losing the enchantment keeping the boat safe underwater. One of the boats surfaced, thinking that at least if the Merfolk were stuck on deck and their sorcerer was free to help them it would be a fair fight, but then they hit it with those fireballs, the sorcerer was able to block a few of them but eventually that boat was brought down. Sofia was amazing she was able to hold the enchantment to keep us under while firing off blasts into the water to take out merfolk where were swimming up to the boat, but before long we were the only boat not sunk or fled. Our captain went to turn back and Sofia blasted him with an enchantment yelling that he was a dserter and then went to take the helm." "Nicolas?!" Oliver asked shocked the Sofia would turn on him. "No", Matias answered, "The Shadow Run wasn't done retrofitting when we'd set sail, since we only had 9 sorcerers we just took the boats that were ready. Anyway she would have taken the helm and driven us straight to our death if we weren't swarmed by Merfolk all of sudden, she had pour all her concentration into fending them off when one of the other sailors took the helm and did what the captain had tried to do, turn around and retreat." They had started decending a set of stairs, "She was furious when we got back to the harbour, demanded that we go out again, blasted one of the sorcerers who had survived when he said no. She was getting ready to start killing the captains of the boats unless they'd take her when I came to get you. You need to talk some sense into her Lucas she respects you, and Oliver she worries about you, you can help her see that it's not the right thing to do." They pushed open a door and stepped out into the fading light. They had decended from the castle hill to the top of the seawall here they could look out over the bay, and the Harbour. There in the harbour just getting undersail was the Shadow Run. "Damnit!" Matias yelled starting to run along the wall to the harbour but before he could go very far the boat had entered the bay.

#Chapter 36. Beneath the Waves
Oliver, Lucas, Osto, and Matias watched as the Shadow Run cut through the water and headed south, just then green streaks of light flashed away from the boat back towards the land. One of them passed right over their heads before slamming into the forest beyond the city with a boom. "What was that?" Matias asked, then as in in answer a rumbling noise. All of a sudden a torrent of water rushed down from the forrest and flooded the inlet where Andmore's harbour was crashing though piers where boats were tied up. "The Shadow fish!" Oliver yelled seeing in the water the dark shapes that had been waiting back in the pool. "She's unleashed the shadow, the fool, she thinks it will help her" Lucas muttered. Just then the Shadow Run turned a shade of blue and slipped beneath the water.
One of the war ships had broken loose from it's mooring and drifted into the harbour, "Can you get us to that ship?" Matias asked Lucas, "What are you trying to do?" Oliver asked confused. "Save her... stop her" Osto looked at the 3 humans and said, "I can get us all there if you trust me" Matias nodded and then Osto looked over the edge of the wall and said, "Follow me" with that he jumped off the wall. Oliver looked over the edge to see him splash into the water below. To his surprise Matias lept over the edge a second later. Looking at Lucas Oliver decided that this would probably not be the craziest thing he'd do before this battle was over and followed. It took only a few seconds to hit the water but it felt like such a long fall that he had time to consider all the things that could go wrong, just then he felt the static tingle of the protection charm and then a soft slide into the water.
Underwater the scene was chaos, Shadow fish were everywhere, hundreds of them or more. The merfolk were everywhere too fighting with spears and enchantments the water was illuminated with flashes of yellow and red. Shadow Run was nowhere to be seen, lost in the chaos - as Sofia had intended. Osto pulled them all along not as fast as normal but avoiding most of the fighting and then with a gesture of his arm they each shot one-by-one out of the water and landed hard on the deck of the warship. Last out was Osto himself. "Best to stay above water for now!" Matias said untieing a line and yanking on it to open a sail before running up to the helm to steer. The warship Oliver realized wasn't meant to be crewed by so few of them. Still even with just one sail the boat quickly picked up speed and turned to the south. All around them the water roiled with shadow fish and merfolk fighting. "We'll have to go faster if we're to catch them" Osto said and then grabbing a line swung off the edge of the boat, he got down near the water and with a wave of his arms a wave appeared out of nowhere and catching the boat pushed it south so fast the sail fell limp as they outpaced the wind. "Take us down!" Osto called up from the edge, as the water around them seemed to grow calmer. Lucas ran to the front of the ship and pressed his hands on the deck, the telltale blue glow encompased the ship and it slide gracefully into the water. Osto had returned to the deck but the current he'd created continued to push them along underwater, behind them Oliver could see the signs of the battle dark shapes of fish and merfolk fighting and flashes of light as enchantments were thrown about. Ahead of them in the distance but growing closer was a dark shape, the Shadow Run. "The entrance to the bay will be guarded" Osto said, "There's no way we're there yet." Lucas said from his position at the front. Oliver remembered the speed that Osto had moved with underwater, and then with the Shadow Run close enough that he could see Nicolas standing at the helm Oliver saw the dark shapes of merfolk moving to intercept the boats. "We'll be outnumbered here!" Osto said, "We need to get to the other boat" Matias turned the ship a little and they kept closing on Shadow Run coming up almost along side it. Osto waved his arms at Oliver and all of a sudden he was fung through the water, landing with a thud on the deck of shadow run right near where Nicolas was at the helm. "Ah Oliver, glad you could join us on this adventure!" Nicolas said, seemingly unconcerned that he was sailing a boat underwater and someone had just been flung aboard. Oliver watched as Matias was launched into the water, then Lucas, as the sorcerers connection to the boat broke the field around it dropped and the boat came to a sudden stop and began to sink. Matias and Lucas landed on the deck midships Sofia from her position near the front turned to Matias and said "I see you ran back to get some traitors did you?" "I brought them to help Sofia, this is suicide!" Matias pleaded but before they could have it out Merfolk droppped out of the water and onto the deck spears drawn.
Oliver had been impressed watching Sofia fight in the cave but the Sofia he saw now on the deck of the Shadow Run was something else. Lucas had seemed to need his all his attention to hold the enchantment on the warship, Sofia barely seemed to give it a thought, instead twirling and whirling about blasting the Merfolk where had come aboard. Swiming along beside them Oliver could make out Osto avoiding the fight but keeping pace. Just then Sofia let out another big blast of green light and from the rear and sides of the boat Oliver saw dark shapes getting closer and closer in the water. A few of the merfolk who had come aboard saw them and tried to swim away only to be intercepted by a shadowy shape. Osto had seen the shadow fish approaching too and with nowhere to go he dropped out of the water and onto the aft of the ship with Oliver, raising his hands in surrender as several of Nicolas' men approached him. Osto was marched down the mid deck and placed in front of Sofia. The other merfolk who had been on the boat had either been captured or pushed off into the waiting Shadow fish who now seemed to swim in synch with the boat. "You're the merfolk whose been helping Oliver?" Sofia asked Osto. "Yes" he replied, "Then help me get to your city" Sofia demanded, "So what you can destroy it?" Osto asked, "I mean to offer a proportional response," Sofia mused, "You destroyed grains and wines that our cities prized so dearly, I'll do the same to yours.", "You mean to destroy our forge." Osto said flatly "Yes, don't worry you can rebuild, although it may take a few generations to do so" Sofia said snidely. "The merfolk who ordered the attack on your city, most of us aren't like that, most of us want peace." Osto pleaded, Sofia turned on him "Enough of you wanted war to attack, and as far as I'm concerned that's enough of you to warrent whatever I see fit to do." Looking up at Sofia, Osto asked, "If I take you to the Forge, will you spare my people?" "As long as they don't get in my way" Sofia said coldly. "Send the shadow fish away." Osto said looking to each side of the boat as the fish formed a neat circle around them. "They're just here to keep us safe." Sofia said studying the fish. "Don't you understand", this time the voice was from Lucas, "they're not here to help us, they've been corrupted by the shadow, they're here to do it's bidding.", "And what is the shadow anyway?" Sofia asked retorically, "It's what happens when human ambition, our thirst for knowledge bumps up against what the merfolk think is best for us. For how long have they kept us confined to this bay, and why, because they think it protects us. Well I'm done being protected, I think it's about time we show the merfolk that our ambition, our power, isn't something they can just limit." "Send the fish away and I'll help you!" Osto added pleading, "they're bloodthirsty if you bring them over Inbrov they'll find the spawning grounds and it won't just a a few generations before we recover, you'll have wiped us out completely." Sofia seemed to consider this for a moment and then with a wave of her arms the fish broke off from the boat and swam away. Osto sood and threw his hands out towards the front of the boat there like a fog lifting the water became clear and just ahead they could see a narrow passage, beyond which a large city sprawled. "The Forge is just past the city proper, to the south east." Osto said pointing to a large collection of round building in the distance.
The Shadow Run sailed lazily along above Inbrov, below them Oliver could see the intriquite architecture of the merfolk. Completely submerged the city could be laid out in three dimensions with merfolk traveling up down, left, and right between structures. From a distance it almost resembeled a corral reef but when viewed up close each of the buildings was clearly something that had been intentionally built. The men onboard the boat all seemed tense, looking at the Oliver realized they were bracing for an attack. Seeing it too Osto spoke, "We have no defenses. At least not beyond the enchantment that I've already lifted, despite how we've acted towards you recently we really are a peaceful people". The pirates didn't relax, Oliver noticed a few new faces amongst the crew but most of these men were on the boat when they'd first found him back in the shadow lands, these were not men to drop their guards easily, and after the attack in the cave Oliver didn't blame them for beleiving the Merfolk to be peaceful.

#Chapter 37. The Great Forge
The Great forge, or just forge as it was called was a massive structure built around a volcanic vent. Here the raw magic that corsed through the earth could be captured and refined, turned into merstones complete with a repitoire of enchantments. As the Shadow Run sailed towards the forge Oliver imagined the Scimitar with Gregory and Delfina and a few handpicked crew doing this one last time before transporting them into his world. As they grew closer Oliver could feel an almost prickling on his skin as if the closeness to the place where the travel stone had last been in this world was having some impact on him. As they passed over Inbrov Lucas had come up beside him. "We're only going to have one chance to do this" he said, "What?" Oliver asked, "The mind binding." Lucas said seemly dumbfounded that Oliver didn't remember, "in order to attack the Forge she'll have to tap into more shadow power and thats when we'll have it close enough to bind it to your mind and send you back to your world." Oliver thought for a moment, "What will happen to the shadow in my world?", "I'm not sure," Lucas answerd, "but it draws its power from enchantments, and without those I don't think it can survive. It should just fade away." Oliver wasn't entirely confident in Lucas' prediction, but the whole thing was such a crazy idea that he wasn't sure it mattered. "What happens if we don't stop her?" Oliver asked, "I think she'll probably try to create another travel stone, this one without the flaws of the one you have, If should could freely travel between the worlds in body and mind then there would be nothing stopping her from conquring your world and ours." Oliver thought about the dreams he'd had of dark shadows swallowing up his mom and sister, shuddering he prepared himself as best he could for the task at hand.
The Shadow Run stopped just short of the vent that the forge was built around, Sofia made her way to the bow of the ship and started to summon a glowing ball of multi-colored energy that spun about in front of her. The field protecting the boat dimmed alittle and Lucas quickly ran to the center of the ship placed his hands on the floor and took over control of the sheilding from Sofia. With all her focus concentrated on the ball of energy she was growing in front of her Sofia began to stretch out her arms and then as if from no where the shadow fish returned, but this time they didn't attack instead coming close to the boat little bits of green energy jumped from the fish into the ball the sofia was forming. One by one she did this and the fish kept swiming to them and then back away. Finally with the ball having reached a few feet across Sofia clammed her hands together and the ball shot through the water and slammed directly into the vent at the center of the forge. The vent glowed red hot and then the ground around it starte to shake. The vent bubbled and then the water above it distorted and became wavy with the heat. The erruption started in earnest after that with lava flowing out of the vent and dark noxious clouds rising through the water and into the air above. The erruption was progressing rapidly, lava poured out of the vent destorying the surrounding builds and then quickly solidfying into rock, slowly raising the the level of the sea floor here and pushing the opening of the vent closer and closer to the surface. From the deck of the shadow run Osto was watching in horror, "You said you'd let my people live!" he pleaded, "I told you they had to stay out of my way. Go to them and let them know now if you wish to save them and tell them that they must get out of my way." Sofia shouted back, as if driven by rage she convulsed and another burst of green energy hit the vent and the erruption seemed to speed up. Osto dove into the water off the side of the boat and swam off towards Inbrov. Meanwhile on the Shadow Run Sofia convulsed again and again each time shooting jets of green energy into the vent and each time the erruption seemed to go a little faster. The pirates on board were watching with shock and awe, unsure of what to do they watched as what had been nothing more than a small rocky ledge grew into a farily large mountain and kept rising and risng out of the sea. By now the vent itself had just emerged from the water, Lucas still holding the enchantment on the ship seemed to adjust his position and Shadow run bobbed to the surface and dropped it's protective field.
On the surface the roar of the erruption was deafening, and the heat scortching, still more and more green jets shot from Sofia into the widening caldera and more and more lava seemed to flow forth. Lucas had run back to Oliver and was shouting to be heard over the erruption. "We can go now, where is Osto?" "He went to save his people!" Oliver shouted back, "What?! but we can't do this without him." "What do you mean?" Oliver asked, "The mind binding I can't do it without him" Lucas said. Oliver looked on in horror as the volcano in front of them continued to grow. "What do you mean you can't do it without him?" Oliver asked, "I don't have a potion for mind binding on me." Oliver looked at the lava flowing freely from the volcano and turning to rock and steam as it reached the water. "I thought you said that was raw magic that?" Oliver asked pointing to the lava, Lucas shook his head, "If I try to use that It'll kill me." Oliver thought about what he could do, he reached into his pocket to find the stone that he could call Osto with, but it was gone, discarded by the merfolk back in the shadow lands. Helpless he just looked on as the volcano continued to grow and grow. Looking into the sky Oliver wasn't sure if it was night or day as a thick cloud of smoke filled the air.
All of a sudden Oliver felt a hand grab his wrist, it was Sofia, she had left the bow of the ship and come to get him. Oliver could see her eyes had turned jet black through and through, whatever was left of Sofia the shadow clearly had control now. "Come traveler", Shadow Sofia said, "It's time for you to help me finish what I started." Sofia started to drag Oliver to the bow of the ship. "Not so fast" Matias stood in the their way sword drawn, "Ha!" Sofia laughed and sent a red blast of energy slamming into Matias knocking him over the side of the ship and into the water. She continued dragging Oliver along until they reached the bow and then with a wave of her hand the two of them shot into the air, slowly floating down to land softly on the newly formed island. The gound beneath their feet was hot and crunched and broke apart as they walked it was hard going but they began their climb to the still erupting summit. Reaching the edge of the caldera Oliver watched as Sofia swirled about her arms and then from the molten rock below out emerged a perfectly flat and perfectly round jet black stone. "Now for your contribution!" she said reaching over and grabbing Olivers head with one hand, Oliver felt his mind get fuzzy had a hard time keeping his thoughts straight, then all of a sudden he snapped back into sharp focus but felt a splitting headache. "NOW!" Lucas' voice called, Oliver could barely turn his head with Sofia's hand grasping it so tightly but there standing just behind him was Lucas one hand squarely placed on Oliver's back the other grasping his merstone. "GO NOW!" Lucas yelled again. Oliver closed his eyes and imagined his mind but this time it wasn't just his mind but his mind a shadow and he imagined them jumping off this ground and flying into space, and into darkness.

#Chapter 38. Release
Oliver awoke in the guest room bed, it was still dark outside. His head throbbed and he thought about rolling over and going back to sleep. There on the bedside table was the travel stone taking it in his hand he remembered what he had to do. Sitting up he closed his eyes and tried to concentration imagining his mind holding on tight to his body but being pulled at by a shadow, he tried to imagine his mind letting go of the shadow, let it pull away it's own way. But the pain in his head got sharper, the shadow didn't want to pull away it wanted to pull Oliver's mind with it somehwere specific. Back to Alland Oliver expected. Even standing and climbing out of the bed Oliver could feel the weight of the shadow pull on his brain. He thought about what would happen if he gave in, he'd drift back to sleep and he'd return to Alland and his friends and his adventures. Then he thought about Lucas who had found a way to enchant his mind and the shadow together even without a potion, the sacrifice that he was making to do that, and Matias who had stood up to Sofia and been kocked aside for it, and Osto who had risked his life to save his people and how many times before had he risked it to save Oliver, and then all the way back to Valeria who had sacrified herself to get him out of the shadow lands. Oliver thought about what he'd be wiling to sacrifice for his friends who had sacrified so much for him. He knew what he needed to do.
Leaving the bedroom Oliver headed down the hall and opened the narrow door that lead up to the attic. There were boxes of holiday decorations and various other knickknacks that had gone into storage over there years. Off to either side of the house were small windows, Oliver opened one, climbed out onto the narrow ledge and then pulled himself up to the roof line. Here the roof was pretty steep but he could sit and inch his way along, as he did so he heard a voice in his head saying "What are you doing! This won't work. Think of all the things you haven't done." Oliver scooted from the side of the house to the front and then inched along further making his way over the driveway. "No soft grass to land on" he thought to himself. "You won't do it, you're too scared" the voice in his head said. Oliver looked over the edge of the roof and stared down that the pavement below. Then he took a deep breath, he could feel the tugging on his mind wasn't pulling him down anymore, and he cleared his head imagining his mind holding on tightly to his body and seeing the shadow there too still holding on, as he stood the shadow grabbed tighter and tighter and then he stepped off the edge and the shadow pushed away and Oliver's mind let it go and watched as it broke apart and disolved into nothing, then he let go of his body and then he wasn't falling anymore. He was standing on the edge of an errupting volcano but time seemed to be frozen, there in front of him stood Sofia, her eyes blinked open for a second and he could see they were no longer the solid back eyes from the boat. Looking down he realized that he was in his pjamas, reaching into his pocket he pulled out the travel stone and held it up in front of him. Sofia reached out, touched it and the white lines on it shone breifly. Then the merstone amulet around Sofia's neck exploded and she was thrown backwards as if in slow motion and then froze mid fall. Oliver looked around, he could see the odd angle of his house as he fell off the roof then over there he could see side of the volcano he was standing on. Over there the large bushes that were just beside the driveway and then the otherway the Shadow Run it's crew trying to get it away from the errupting volcano. Oliver realized he could make a choice here, step to one side and he would be fully in Alland with all it's aventure, and pirates, and enchantment. His mom would wake up to find him missing, his picture would be printed on the back of a milk carton but no one in his world would ever see him again. but a step to the other side and he'd go back to, he wasn't sure what, he was falling from the roof, at least if he died in his world his mom would have some closure, she'd know what happened to him and not be searching for him for the rest of her life. Finally making a decision he stepped to the side and pictured his mind again reaching back out and grabbing his body and pulling itself back in.

#Chapter 39. Between Worlds
Oliver fell, he hit the bushes, they sagged under his weight catching him and then rolling and throwing him off to the side, he bounced off the car setting off the alarm and landed hard on the driveway. He was hurt, probably something broken, but he was alive, he heard the tell-tale honking of the car alarm. Exhausted he reached into his pocket feeling the travel stone still there he touched it, closed his eyes and imagined his mind letting go of his body and drifting away.
In front of him Sofia fell back to the ground, behind him Lucas dropped his hands and looked at him "Is it done?" the sorcerer asked. "Yes!" Oliver shouted over the rumble of the erruption around them. Oliver could see Lucas hand where it had been holding the merstone, it was red and cut up, the merstone around his neck glowed a dull red. The mountain rumbled and more lava spilled up and over the edge of the volcano, "You need to get her out of here" Lucas said gesturing to Sofia who lay on the ground unconsious. Oliver looked at her, the sorceress wasn't much taller them him and her thin frame meant she probably didn't weigh much. Looking down the hill he saw the path they had walked up, the smooth rock from the erruption had been broken up by their footsteps and created a path of loose rocks. If he pulled Sofia she's slide down it may hurt but she'd survive. "GO!" Lucas shouted looking into the air as another fountain of Lava shot up and crashed down on the side of the mountain. Spurred to action Oliver grabbed Sofia by her wrists and pulled her as he turned and started heading down the mountain. It was slow going, the corse gravel they'd created on their way up helped her to slide a bit her body was still mostly dead weight pulling agains the rock. All around him small rocks rained down as the volcano rumbled and shook getting louder and more violent with each passing step. Oliver looked ahead to the water were Shadow run was waiting anchored. A small boat was being lowered over the side, just then the volcano shook and he pulled on Sofia and she barely moved and he realized that he wasn't going to make it. Just then Oliver saw a shape moving up the mountain towards him, he saw the large body and broad shoulders and recognized the man almost at once. Matias was coming to rescue him. The volcano shook but Matias seemed sure footed and driven he didn't break stride. He reached Oliver a minute later and looked at Sofia laying on the ground, "Is she?" he asked, "She's alive, just unconsious" Olvier said reassuringly. Oliver looked Matias over, his face and arms were red as though he's been burned badly, his chest where Sofia had blasted him looked almost black. Almost without stopping Matias scooped Sofia up and threw her over his shoulders, then turning to Oliver asked "Where's Lucas?" Oliver looked around, he'd assumed the sorcerer would follow them down the volcano, then looking up high up to the peak he saw the old man gestruing wildly for them to go. "He's staying behind, let's go!" Oliver said resolutely, Matias nodded and turned, practically running down the side of the volcano as Oliver struggled to keep up.
As they reached the water the boat had been lowered and was making its way to them but Matias didn't stop to wait he ran into the steaming water pushing forward towards the boat, Oliver followed. He instantly felt a stab of pain in both his legs as the water burned him but he kept running knowing that any chance he had of escaping the volcano meant getting to the boat as quickly as he could. The water was up to his wait by the time he grabbed the side of the small boat and was pulled in by a pirate. There laying on the floor of the boat was Sofia, Matias sat and the boat turned quickly and started to make it's way to the Shadow Run. Behind them the volcano gave another violent shake then then a lull. Oliver could hear a low rumble getting louder and louder but no more lava seemed to be errupting. Looking up he thought he could just make out Lucas' form still standing at the summit. The boat had pulled up along side Shadow Run who was already pulling up it's anchor and mast. A rope was tossed to the boat tied around Sofias chest and her body was hoisted aboard, ladders had been lowered down the side and people climbed on to them 2 at a time not bothering to secure the small row boat. Oliver was one of the last ones on the ladder, he climbed as quickly as he could watching as all the sails of the Shadow run were pulled open and the heat from the volcano blasted into them pushing them through the water. The low rumbling sound had now grown deafening and it was all Oliver could do not to let go of the ladder and cover his ears. He kept climbing until he pulled himself up over the edge of the deck and fell helplessly onto the floor. The climb up the mountain, the run back down, it all hit Oliver at once and he felt exhausted. The black clouds above his head blocked out any light but he imagined that it must be day by now. Then the volcano exploded.
A huge chunk of the side of the mountain they'd just climbed down was thrown into the air and slammed down into the water at the base of the mountain, with the strong convection current from the volcano the Shadow Run had made good distance but as the rock hit the water it pushed up a huge wave that threatened to engulf the boat. "HOLD FAST!" Nicolas' voice called from the helm. Everywhere pirates were grabbing onto lines and ropes Oliver grabbed the railing beside him he felt the boat raised into the air and then saw the wave towering over them. He closed his eyes waiting for the wave to break over the ship. He didn't feel anything, then opened his eyes. All around the boat a blue field held back the water, at the helm Nicolas was carefully turning the wheel moving the boat out of the way of debris that were falling through the water. At the bow amazingly Sofia lay, both hands on the deck propping herself up with one arm and watching the water ahead. The boat turned slightly to avoid a rock, and then up ahead Oliver could see the tell tall shimmer of the surface of water, not the murkey depths that surrounded them. They were going to make it out of the wave. Just then Oliver saw Sofia collapse the blue field protecting the boat collapsed with her and water flooded onto them. The Shadow run floated, momentarily held boyant by the air in it's water tight holds. Oliver held on for dear life and watched as they slid slowly to the edge of the water, they were almost there, and then they started to sink and Oliver's lungs screamed out for air. Then as if by magic the water seemed to move back pushing itself over the ship and they were out. A sudden sinking feeling hit Oliver, the boat had emerged from the wave about 5 feet above the water, it fell with a loud crash and splash, then all of a sudden Oliver saw the bow ahead of him fold back on itself with a wrenching noise. Oliver could see Matias holding onto Sofia with one arm and a rail with another. As the bow collapsed he let go of the railing and slid back to the middeck. "ABBANDON SHIP!" was the cry from Nicolas and all the pirates started to scramble to their feet, helping one another up and jumping off the sides. Oliver didn't bother to see where they were he stood. Oliver looked at Matias carrying Sofias limp body upright. She wouldn't be able to swim! He rushed over the the big man and helped him support Sofia, together they got to the side and looked down at the sea below. "On 3?!" Oliver asked but a loud splintering of the boat told them both that they should go now and together they jumped holding Sofia between them.
Oliver and Matias hit the water and kicked hard being sure to keep their arms wrapped around Sofia. They popped their heads above the water and then straining were able to bring Sofia's head up above the water. Oliver's arms and legs ached as he tried to tread water and stay float. He could tell from Matias' pained expression that he was about to give up. Oliver looked around for something, anything they could swim to and use to float. The Shadow Run had slammed into large rocks split in 2 and the back half was now sinking around them pirate were scattered in the water, many swimming towards the rocks where the bow of the ship was lodged. "Come on!" Oliver said to Matias and started to swim pulling Sofia in the direction of the rocks. Matias was straining so hard he couldn't speak but kicked and pulled with his free hand seeming determined not to give up until they were safe. Looking behind them Oliver saw the tidal wave that had engulfed the ship it had changed direction and was now moving back towards the wreckage of the volcano. Just then large hands grasped Oliver's shoulders and pulled him. It was one of the pirates, the water here wasn't so deep and Oliver found in another few feet could stand with his head above the water. Another one of the pirates had grabbed Sofia and pulled her to the safety of a large rock, Matias for his part tried to swim on for another few seconds before passing out. One of the pirates grabbed him and pulled him out of the water, laying him next to Sofia. Finally relaxing Oliver turned and looked back at where the wave had crashed into the volcano. The air was thick with a cloud of dense steam as the water had cooled the freshly formed rock and evaporated. The column of steam reached the dark cloud that the volcano had errupted and Oliver could see flashes of lightning where the two clouds collided. He heard thunder roll in and then it began to rain. It was a thick soupy rain, all the dust and dirt that had been thrown into the air was trapped by all the water that had boiled from the sea and it all came falling down to earth. Oliver watched as more lighting ripped through the clouds heard the thunder and then watched as more rain started to fall. All around him the pirates were laughing and cheering. The rain felt like a victory the dark clouds were soon robbed of enough of their density that the sun could cut through and a rainbow appeared in the sky. Oliver laughed, surely this was a sign that they'd defeated the shadow. Pulling himself up on a rock Oliver lay back and felt the heavy rain fall on his face with his eyes closed. He let his mind drift.
Oliver opened his eyes to the presistent beep beep beep of the car alarm and his mom shouting "OLIVER!", he opened his eyes and she rushed to him, "oh my god! what happened?" she asked, weakly Oliver let out an "I'm fine!" before closing his eyes again and feeling is mind drift off.
"Oliver of the other world?" a deep horse voice asked, Oliver opened his eyes and there before him stood a tall merfolk, soft featured like Osto but different. He was flanked on both sides by the lankier merfolk holding spears. "Yes?" Oliver said confused. "I am King Eeli of the Southern Deep, ruler of all the seas." Oliver looked around, merfolk were emerging from the water here and there. "You saved us from the tidal wave?" Oliver asked understanding now how a wave suddenly changed direction, "That was my brothers doing," the merking turned and there emerging from the water was Osto. "Osto!" Oliver yelled excited that his friend had made it, he ran to him as best he could through the shallow water and gave the merfolk a big hug. Osto for his part didn't seem to understand what hugs were and took a second to figure out that Oliver was happy to see him. "We owe you a great debt for what you have done" Eeli said, "reversing the tidal wave is not enough to pay that back", "My friends!" Oliver turned to where Sofia and Matias had been laid, the king gave a nod and merfolk picked the two of them up and placing them in the water and began to place healing enchantments over them. Other merfolk came up to the pirates who milled about, many had minor injuries but most hadn't been too badly hurt in the escape. "This is done" Eeli said, but still I must ask you for something more so that we may not be in your debt. Oliver thought for a minute but drew a blank and then to his left Nicolas stepped forward, "I have an idea." he said.

# Epilog

Oliver awoke to the familar sight of the blue curtained hospital room and the familar beep-beep of the a heart rate monitor. He looked at his left arm expecting to see an IV but isntead saw a dark blue cast encasing his upper arm and shoulder. His mom was watching him closely from her chair and standing up she came over to him. "Are you ok?" Oliver asked, "Am I ok!? What kind of question is that?" his mom seemed incredulous, "although actually any more hospital trips planned for this summer since I'd like to make sure I know about them ahead of time?", "No", Oliver said looking at the cast on his arm, "I think I'm done with adventures for this summer." "What happened anyway?" his mom asked. "I'm not sure, Oliver tried to remember the night before but things seemed hazy like it had all been a dream" "Well whatever it was, don't do it again ok!" his mother's tone had a mocking attidude of chastizing to it. Smiling she said, "Now the doctors have told me you need to rest, so rest, I don't think they're going to let me take you home today, not after you've been brought in for 2 emergencies in 2 days" Oliver smiled, his mom smiled back and then said "I'll go get you some breakfast" she headed out of the room. Oliver looked over at the small table beside his hospital bed, there placed neatly as though it were part of the decor was the travel stone. Reaching for it Oliver held the stone in his hand and closed his eyes.
Oliver awoke on the soft bed and looked out the window, sun shone in and he could smell the sweet scent of flowers mixing with the tangy salt of surf. He left the small cottage and followed the gravel path down, as it cut it's way through Sun lilys and Blue Iris to the sandy beach. Taking off his shoes he stepped onto the black sand and felt the soft warmth that it radiated back. He walked along scanning the horizon and saw a few ships passing though the narrows. Some headed back to Andmore and Orless, others, like him, bound for the port at Álvaross. The port was busy this early in the morning. Boats were unloading supplies, grains from Andmore, Wine from Orless and taking on boxes filled with the refined powders that were made from the sun lilies, and the Blue Ireses, and the royal orchids. Raw stones were being unloaded from a boat bearing the green flag of Andmore, while a man wearing a yellow tunic that identified him as an official representiative of the merfolk oversaw the operation. Then at the last pier Oliver saw the ship he'd been looking for. It was low to the water, kind of squat and odd shaped with 2 masts and emblazoned on the back the name "Shadow Run II". Oliver had teased Nicolas that it needed a new name when he'd first unveiled it, but he knew that no other name suited the vessel. On board Oliver could see Nicolas overseeing the process as crate after crate was brought up the gangway and loaded into the hold. "Want to come with us" the voice said jokingly from behind him. Oliver turned to see Matias and Sofia walking together through he chaos of the port towards him. "Depends where you are going?" Oliver asked faciously. "Oliver!" Nicolas had heard his voice and was now leaning over the side of the ship. "You must come with us!" the pirate insisted. "I think my adventuring days are over." Oliver said reluctantly, "Come on" Sofia proded at him having reached him now. "We're going to follow the magical currents and see what's north. There's probably a whole other island there from an earlier erruption." Oliver looked at Sofia skeptically, "Did you ask Osto about this." "If we ask", Nicolas shouted down, "then they'll tell us some silly name and that's what will be on all the maps, if we go discover it for ourselves we can give it a proper name like Aetos!" "If we find an island we're not naming it after you!" Sofia called up, turning back to Oliver she spoke in a quiet voice, "There's something there alright, King Osto, was a bit too busy to give us all the details.", looking at Matias Oliver asked, "You've agreed to this adventure?" "Hey someone has to keep her safe." Matias said with a smile and quickly got a jab in his ribs from Sofia. "Maybe we'll leave you on that island" Sofia quipped. Oliver smiled. "As tempting as this adventure sounds he added, I think I'd prefer to go sit on the beach and relax." Matias smiled and laughed, Sofia shook her head and followed a crate aboard Shadow Run II. Matias went to follow her and Oliver offered a "safe travels!", "You too" Matias replied heading up the gangway.
Oliver got back to the beach before the Shadow Run II set sail, he watched as it turned out of the harbour and made to skirt it's way around the eastern edge of Alland and head for the northern sea. As it left the harbour behind Oliver saw the tell tail blue glow of the protective field surround the boat and then it slipped underwater and was gone. He returned to the small cottage sat on the bed, took a deep breath smelling the sea air again, closed his eyes and let his mind drift.
